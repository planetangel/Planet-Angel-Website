During three years I produced twenty-six original images for Planet Angel. The reason for the use of a lego man in some of the images is because Planet Angel provided buckets of little bricks for revellers to play with when they were cooling off from hours of dancing.</P>\r\n<P>You can view the complete set of flyers that I produced for the club by visiting my website at <A href=\"http://www.demont.co.uk/pa/\" mce_href=\"http://www.demont.co.uk/pa/\">http://www.demont.co.uk/pa/</A></P>\r\n<P>love</P>\r\n<P>Charlie</P>\r\n<P mce_keep=\"true\">&nbsp;</P>','1','12','0','48','2006-02-06 22:02:10','70','','2008-05-02 11:32:15','64','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2006-02-06 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','charlie-hat.jpg|right|[CHARLIE]|1|Charlie|bottom||','','pageclass_sfx=\nback_button=\nitem_title=1\nlink_titles=\nintrotext=1\nsection=0\nsection_link=0\ncategory=0\ncategory_link=0\nrating=\nauthor=\ncreatedate=\nmodifydate=\npdf=\nprint=\nemail=\nkeyref=\ndocbook_type=','21','0','8','','','0','1642','charlie-de-montagnac');

People were just being.</p>  <p>There was a constant sea of bodies in front of the canvasses, all adding their signature. One guy created a huge beautiful pink heart with handprints. Hours later another guy filled the centre of the heart with a beautiful poem. Many people decided to paint each other - or themselves. </p>  <p>After a few hours there were so many people it was hard to move. Sitting, talking eating, drinking, painting, listening, dancing, sharing, caring. A little girl on her dad\'s shoulders, staring at the tiny blue sun on each side of the entrance, pumping to the chilled tunes. Both were transfixed. In another corner a girl danced, wrapped in the delicate purple-and-white silk cloth that demarked Planet Angel\'s space. </p>  <p>Outside the Space, the atmosphere was amazing. People had come together in the name of expression and transformed this car park into a mind-bending crazy maze of human fantasy. </p>        <p>At some hour of the morning, we turned down the tunes, and Spacegirl took the microphone. She delicately recited her poem \'When will someone love me?\' to a packed crowd and mesmerised them. We all know what the early hours can be like, come-down, come-up, f**k-up, frustration, exhaustion, exhilaration, but this was amazing, it was like a cool calm breeze, brain fodder, head massage and more. </p>        <p>To be able to indulge a crowd like that proves how powerful the Planet Angel concept is.

We welcome musical contributors who are aware that they are\r\nnot the controlling factor over the space and appreciate the other\r\nelements. </p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/music1.jpg\" width=\"156\" height=\"194\" style=\"float: left;\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" border=\"0\" />We provide a balance of music across the venue with three\r\nareas, each with a unique vibe; this offers a choice of music and means\r\nthe rooms are not competing. Variety within genres is a key aspect of\r\nthe music in all three rooms, reflecting the diversity of the people\r\nthat come. Put simply, the vibe thrives on music that leads somewhere -\r\nthat goes on a journey. </p>\r\n<h4>Meltdown Room</h4><p>The music policy for this room is ‘Positive\r\nDance Music’ which is deliberately non-genre-specific.&nbsp; We want to\r\nprovide the best in positive, driving edge, lively, uplifting 4/4 dance\r\nmusic... The only way to truly understand what we are looking for is to\r\ncome to The Party. The Meltdown Room is the largest and the vibe is\r\nfairly full on! We\'re looking for a bit of variation of styles, rather\r\nthan long sets of exactly the same style. This room also hosts live\r\nperformances although live performance space is limited.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/music4.jpg\" width=\"169\" height=\"192\" style=\"float: right;\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" border=\"0\" /></p><h4>Funky Lounge</h4><p>Positive, genre defying, funky\r\nbeats to make your hips swing and your ears smile... The music is\r\nfunky, bouncy, eclectic and fun in here! With a very different feel to\r\nthe 4/4 styles played in the Meltdown Room, the Funky Lounge offers\r\ngood scope to play many styles. This room has a buzz like that of a\r\nparty and a crowd that not only expects to dance, but to have fun and\r\nbe surprised. Variety is pretty much essential in this room - we\'re\r\nlooking for an eclectic mix of various styles whilst keeping the vibe\r\nupbeat, rather than long sets of the same style. This room also hosts\r\nlive performances although again live performance space is limited.</p>\r\n<h4>Chill Bar</h4><p>Positive, chilled, eclectic, laid back grooves,\r\nbeats and melodies from around the genre globe... This room is small\r\nand cosy with a very laid back feel. The DJ is very integrated with the\r\nparty people. We\'re looking for beautiful music in here… chilled,\r\neclectic, trip hop, Ibiza sunset \'Café del Mar\' style… basically the\r\nkind of music that gets the head nodding, the foot-tapping and the\r\nsmile spreading! Solo instrumentalists are well received in the Chill\r\nbar. </p>\r\n<h3>Music Policy... At Planet Angel *Chilled*</h3>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/legodecks.png\" width=\"241\" height=\"156\" style=\"float: left;\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" border=\"0\" />This is a family friendly event and the music needs to be\r\njust right. The vibe at *Chilled* is bright &amp; breezy with a very\r\nlaid back feel. We normally integrate the DJ/ stage with the people and\r\nwe\'re looking for beautiful music similar to the Chill bar at the\r\nParty… chilled, eclectic, trip hop, Ibiza sunset \'Café del Mar\' style…\r\nagain the kind of music that gets the head nodding, the foot-tapping\r\nand the smile spreading!</p>\r\n<p>We gently build up the tempo and the volume of the music from the\r\nstart (normally about 2pm) into more of a boogie-zone from around 7pm,\r\nthe music becoming funky, bouncy, eclectic and fun, offering good scope\r\nto play many styles including big beat, break beat, funk and global\r\ndance. We tend to avoid 4/4 beats or trance type styles at *Chilled*,\r\nbut aim to create a buzz (as per the Funky Lounge at The Party) like\r\nthat of a party and a crowd that expects to dance, have fun and be\r\nsurprised. Variety is pretty much essential at this time of night -\r\nwe\'re looking for an eclectic mix of various styles whilst keeping the\r\nvibe upbeat, rather than long sets of the same style.</p>\r\n<p>It’s really important that the volume is balanced for enough of a\r\ngood dance, but not ear splitting due to the children attending. Due to\r\nthe social and interactive nature of *Chilled* live performances need a\r\n‘presence’ about them, as party people tend to continue chatting,\r\nplaying and socialising.

I am wondering how I got here. </p>\r\n<p>The kitchen is In Reickendorf, Berlin. Pierre is 28 years old. He was born with a congenital disease which left him mentally and physically disabled. He needs help with all aspects of daily life; he can not talk or walk. His favourite colour is aqua green, he likes soft toy snakes, being in the woods and going on buses. Group one is part of Furst Donnersmark hause. A rehabilitation centre and home for people with disabilities. Group one was created in 1982, with seven residents, all here from infancy. </p>','<p><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/newsletter/niti2.jpg\" width=\"233\" height=\"175\" style=\"float: right;\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" border=\"0\" />Of the original Seven, three have died and Jack aged 21, Stephannie aged 22 and Thorsten 27 have all come to the group in the last 10 years. Jack is the only member of the group that can talk. Dennis aged 30 is the only one who can walk independently, however, he was born brain damaged due to alcohol poisoning while he was in the womb. He is also very autistic and has epilepsy. He is the group artist, he makes sculptures out of boxes and bins covered in plastic bags, piled up on top of each other. He loves music and whistling and green coloured materials. Ugar 31 is the oldest member, he and Ozay 29 are in my opinion the most intelligent members of the group. They get sarcasm and sometimes make jokes themselves. Ozay has a real sense of fashion and really lets you know when he doesn\'t want to wear something. Ugar is one of the sweetest men I have ever met and very good at making Lego. </p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/newsletter/niti3.jpg\" width=\"187\" height=\"140\" style=\"float: left;\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" border=\"0\" />Group one is the only non-rehabilitation group in FDH, the residents will never live an independent life. My job at FDH is to help with all aspects of daily life, when I feel I can. I am mainly responsible for the guys free time activities. We play games, go for strolls in the woods, go shopping do arty stuff like pottery and painting. Every Friday I take two of them to the snoezelen raum, this is a therapy room. It had UV lights, optic fiber lights, music, instruments and a huge water bed and lots of other lights and things. It’s very cool and the group really enjoy using it. </p>\r\n<p>Six months ago, I didn\'t speak a word of German, now I hardly use English. Six months ago I had never been on holiday by myself, now I\'ve made a life for myself in one of the coolest cities in the world. I never thought I could work with disabled people, I never thought I could make a difference to someone\'s life. When I first arrived at FDH I found it to be a very strange world. I found it difficult to interact with Ozay and the others. To me everything seemed to be so different and I just had no way to communicate. I never thought then that I would become their friend. A year ago I had quit my PGCE course, was in a temp job I hated. I felt like I was just living for the weekend with no direction. I felt like I was just another face in the crowd. All around me I could see people who needed help; I just didn\'t know what I could do. </p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/newsletter/niti5.jpg\" width=\"163\" height=\"122\" style=\"float: right;\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" border=\"0\" />I had heard about the European volunteers scheme from a polish girl, while I lived in Brighton. The scheme provides me with a home and 170 euro a month; it also provided me with two weeks of German lessons. My project on top of that gives me 200 euro and a travel card. Unfortunately this is the last year of the EVS however a new scheme open to 20-30 year olds is starting next year. There are hundreds of opportunities to live and work abroad and government based ones do not charge you! My job and the last six months have been incredibly tough, but I wouldn\'t want to be anywhere else. Now, I love my life. </p>','1','1','0','53','2006-04-24 12:43:06','65','Niti','2006-08-27 15:50:39','70','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2006-04-24 12:31:23','0000-00-00 00:00:00','newsletter/niti2.jpg|right||0||bottom||\r\nnewsletter/niti3.jpg|left||0||bottom||\r\nnewsletter/niti5.jpg|right||0||bottom||\r\n','','pageclass_sfx=\r\nback_button=\r\nitem_title=1\r\nlink_titles=\r\nintrotext=1\r\nsection=0\r\nsection_link=0\r\ncategory=0\r\ncategory_link=0\r\nrating=\r\nauthor=\r\ncreatedate=\r\nmodifydate=\r\npdf=\r\nprint=\r\nemail=\r\nkeyref=\r\ndocbook_type=','9','0','7','','','0','872','news-from-afar');

So, just by hiring Planet Angel, a corporation will be fulfilling some of its Corporate Social Responsibilities, how cool is that?</P>\r\n<P>There is no glossy, slick organisation on offer here; there is much more than that.

Its not that they are not used or people don\'t spend money on them, just that lights are rarely used as \'part\' of the music and vice versa. The aim of Planet Angel\'s light show is to integrate seamlessly with the whole environment; the vibe, the art, the music, the time of day or night... everything!<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Our policy re: lighting is to own as much of the kit used at events as possible and we have built up quite a lot of kit as a result. Some of the key units have been custom built so that Planet Angel has a unique lighting system that integrates with the music with more synchronicity and ‘feel’ than other systems. For example the Analogue Lighting Controller analyses the music and lets the operator sync the lights to many different aspects of the music, including low-beat, hi-beat, silence, inverse and logical combinations of those mentioned and many others. It also can detect ‘trancy’ passages of music and trigger lights/lasers accordingly. Using careful analysis and logic functions we can sync the lights perfectly to the bass or hi-hat beat even allowing for bulb warm-up times.</P>\r\n<P>Interestingly our system has led to the conclusion that you can’t use filament bulbs to sync perfectly to the beat because the strike and after-glow cycle is too long – even with compensation techniques, when we do it with strobes, however, Wo! It is dead on the beat, what we need to do to perfect the system, is use LED bulbs.. We are currently evaluating LED technology for two reasons: a) so that we can develop a new very environmentally friendly system and eventually replace all of the wasteful ‘traditional’ bulbs, which means a much lower power system with less storage and less waste of power and resources (glass, metal etc); and b) so that we can offer Party People the tightest, most synched lighting system ever(!), further heightening the experience in the Meltdown Room and at other Planet Angel events.</P>\r\n<H3>AV</H3>\r\n<P>We use a couple of digital projectors (that we own), one for general visual effects and another one to project a playstation game.&nbsp; We prefer to use unusual screens and projection surfaces and have worked with a number of talented VJs to create some great effects.&nbsp; We see projectors as a great tool for creating a visual environment but believe that if badly set up they can sometimes produce too much spill or ambient light.</P>\r\n<H3>Webcast</H3>\r\n<P>We often webcast our Parties.&nbsp; We are fortunate enough to have the support of a web streaming company who provide the pipe for the webcasts (please see the Crew &amp; Contributor Page).&nbsp; We also have the mixer, compressor and mikes to be able to provide a high quality stream feed complete with crowd noise and talk over.&nbsp; We are interested to hear from any organisations that may be interested in re-streaming our webcasts.</P>\r\n<H3>Getting Involved Technically</H3>\r\n<P>If you’re a VJ and would like to get involved, please see the <A href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=68&amp;Itemid=27\" mce_href=\"/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=68&amp;Itemid=27\">Artists &amp; Performers page</A>, if you’re a Techie and would like to get involved please see the <A href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=127&amp;Itemid=27\" mce_href=\"/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=127&amp;Itemid=27\">Crew page</A>.

We received a fine display of reactions to this offering, ranging from mild concern as to what was in the cup to absolute delirium!! All of us who took turns to serve drank more than we gave away and felt pretty happy for a good few hours, so this was a pretty good start to what became a mental nite!!<br /><br />The Chill Bar was more chilled than ever before with a larger carpeted area and low tables, which resulted in a mass of bodies all talking and hugging each other, surrounded by numerous Lego creations and in the front room a broad range of outrageous sweat inducing, bouncy tunes and relocated Big Jenga and Connect 4 worked perfectly!<br /><br /><a href=\"index.php?option=com_zoom&amp;Itemid=55&amp;page=view&amp;catid=19&amp;PageNo=1&amp;key=14&amp;hit=1\"><div class=\"mosimage\"  style=\" float: right; margin: 5px;\" align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/gallery/20020111/thumbs/glenn03.jpg\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" border=\"0\" /><div class=\"mosimage_caption\">by Glenn Dunwell</div></div></a> In the main room the music and dancing and smiling was almost too much to bear, and at 3am Liquid Crystal performed an awesome show using crystal balls and immense talent which had the whole room in awe...<br /><br />There is of course so much more to tell, but let us end by saying a huge thank you to all the people who spent time creating amazing costumes... too many to mention individually, but you all looked incredible!<br />&nbsp;</p><p>Here\'s a selection of your comments... more are in the Guestbook!</p><p> <em><a href=\"index.php?option=com_zoom&amp;Itemid=55&amp;page=view&amp;catid=19&amp;PageNo=1&amp;key=10&amp;hit=1\"><div class=\"mosimage\"  style=\" float: left; margin: 5px;\" align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/gallery/20020111/thumbs/11january_8.jpg\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" border=\"0\" /><div class=\"mosimage_caption\">by Ian Hunter</div></div></a> &quot;Just thought I\'d drop you all an email to say thanks for the outstanding sets played in the main room on Friday night. I\'d been going to whirl-y-gig for a while, before I discovered PA,&nbsp; as I loved the vibe and the people but always thought the music a little too varied -- uplifting in places, but then snatched away at the vital moment. I\'d previously spent a number of years going to places such as Escape from Samsara, Pendragon, Tribal Kaos, Astral Phoenix et al as the music blew the place apart, but the vibe/people were not as consistently friendly as Whirly.<br /><br />So, enter Planet Angel -- perfection -- the vibe, friendliness and people that I\'d grown to love at Whirly, coupled with the consistently uplifting music of previous clubs [although slightly less hard to complement the PA vibe]. Add a Friday night to leave the whole weekend to recover, and a 6am finish and I was in heaven.<br /><br />Thanks again for a serious of outstanding sets -- keep up the good work guys ;-))<br /><br />Thanks for listening, and I look fwd to more great PA nights to come.&quot;</em><br /><strong>Wicksy</strong><br /><br /></p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;Dear Planet Angel, Just wanted to drop you a line about the last party.

A surprisingly calm rig followed, which gave us time to think about extra finishing touches.<BR><BR>As 10pm drew closer the atmosphere became charged with a mixture of apprehension and excitement, as we all dashed around (and into each other) tying up those final bits and pieces before we could fling open the golden gates! With the first arrival of Angels came a sweep of fresh air, as the music began and the lights began to twirl majestically around the walls, transforming everything they touched.<BR><BR>There were a HUGE number of drums waiting to be let loose a little later for the drumming session - you could feel them rumbling in their brightly coloured bags as they came in. The drumming sesh was planned for 1am in the front room, but it actually kicked off a lot earlier - and the tension building up to an excellent selection of tracks in the front room was electric!! We turned off the music as planned (yep!) and the boy did the drummers drum! With Rhythm Works and Drumscape holding it down, everyone went mad! Clapping and whooping and dancing and drumming and finding raised surfaces to stand on to watch as they got faster and faster and faster and faster… a surge of energy rushing around the room like a whirlwind sucking us all in before we had time to realise what was happening!<BR><BR>After such a fine display of human rhythm and synchronicity, a dazed and confused crowd wandered from this mayhem into other areas of the party…<BR><BR>Sounds4peace created a beautiful ambience in the chill bar, DJ and Didge playing together seamlessly like true brothers, and further bimbling led to lovely plasticene and Lego models, a mass of arms, legs and feet massaging each other on the carpet in the chill bar, some FANTASTIC artwork on the canvass (who painted the tree with the drumming lady underneath??) lots of smiles and bubbles, fluro things and of course, some unbeatable dance-mania in the main room… arms flailing in the air, legs a shaking, smiles a bursting… yeah!<BR><BR>The evening drew to a beautiful close with fabulous sounds in every area and a vibe to die for - this Party was very special, it seemed to generate limitless amounts of energy to continue on our mission to do something useful and positive in our world.<BR><BR>So huge thanks to everyone… we all play a part in these parties, whether it be to setup the environment, or fill it with our beautiful personalities and creativeness…<BR><BR>So, until the next time!!! </P>\r\n<H3>Review, by Sacha Ryder</H3>\r\n<P>Planet Angel party Review \"Drums for the rhythm of Life\" - 8th February<BR><BR>An instant dilemma was created for alot of the party people of Planet Angel when the 2001 dates were announced and we found ourselves with an Angel and Whirl-y-gig Back to Back weekender with P.A. on the Friday 8th and Whirly Sat 9th!!! Oh………. Crikey.<BR><BR>Lots of debate took place in the month after the Jan 11th Planet Angel when realisation set in proper and continued through Planet Angel Chilled in January which incidentally was more \"Planet Angel - tried to chill out but thought, Ah what the F**K , lets go Large!\"<BR><BR>In fairness most people said \"Damn , I don\'t want to have to choose, I want all my cake and I like a break between the Two Parties! \" but even though some people chose to save themselves for the Saturday Whirly, the Planet Angel party people stepped up to the plate and there was a really great turnout. This will have been in part due to last nights tantalising arrangement of events of Drummin sessions, Back to back DJ Playoffs and all the usual Fun stuff to do.<BR><BR>A stormin evening to add to the many I have logged in the old noodle bank of fun experiences.. not necessarily very well filed or with a great date or time system.. but you get the picture. Each PA I do I have a different experience or evening at each one. At Jan 11ths Party it was \"Spend all night in between Front Tropical bar (my name for it!) bouncing around to Butterfly Pete\'s terrific sets and Main room dancing my feet off\",<BR><BR>Last night was spent doing some dancing but mostly Chilling out talking to Planet Angel virgins and getting massaged in the chillout room (an interesting place to be massaged I can tell you!) . I met Luke and Claire and another bloke (sorry , miss-filed name!) in the UV corridor at the start of the night, establishing that this was their first Planet Angel, gave them a thorough welcome ,( which you should all do if you meet someone new to our Party!) and gave them the run down of stuff they could do and what was going on. I bumped into them later in the chillout room. They were right into it and were having a fantastic time having made a menagerie of playdoh animals. Luke said they\'d been invited by Rolo (good Man!) in a pub last week and came along not sure what to expect but were having the best time ever. Claire gave me an excellent shoulder and head massage and big hugs went all round…. So you see people , just give a bit of yourself and it will be returned in spades. I know they will be back and are a great addition to the Planet Angel Massif.<BR><BR>What I did catch was the superb drumming session that was set to start at 1am but with a Samba(?) of drummers assembling and expectant crowd building up they probably started playing along with the DJ around 1230.. and what a session.. there was a good selection of different drummers and styles, Large ones , small ones , bongos. They were all there! And boy did they play.. cor!, a very well co-ordinated session of varying beats and rythms to stir the soul and get the feet moving….lets face it if it didn\'t get you moving you must have been dead and even then I think there would have been some foot tapping or hip shaking (as in \"weekend at Bernies 2\"!!)<BR><BR>I was told I missed a bangin\' back to back set between DJ Therapy and TequilaC but I got the last hour in the main room to finish off on which was its usual hard and uplifting time.. All to soon 6 o\'clock rolled round and before I knew it I was on my way back home in the company of good friends and chilled tunes having met some fantastic new people, put some faces to names, and wondering if I\'m going to be fit for Whirly tonight.<BR><BR>Well , I\'ve had a sleep and dammit I\'m going, if only for long enough to see my ever burgeoning family of Party friends. Its the same back to back calendar next month (Planet Angel Fri 8th March, Whirlygig Sat 9th March) so get the vitamins in Kids and get ready to do it all again, and don\'t forget Planet Angel Chilled on February 24th.<BR><BR>On a last note check out the Invites for the March Party, they are superb with a special Planet Angel Lego man on them. Best one yet I reckon!<BR><BR>Keep safe and let the party rock your soul!

A party that despite moving to a new venue with more like-minded people than ever before, remained the friendly, easy, gathering that is the trademark of the parties.<br /><br />As we all enter a new phase on our journey and our third summer of parties, we felt it was right to attempt the near impossible: to try to thank those who pulled together to make it happen and those who have done so in the past.<br /><br />We can\'t begin explain in detail the hard work put in by so many people, nor can we thank them enough or properly, for their love, commitment, effort and support, but here is our attempt…<br /><br />Some people worked for weeks before the last party, designing new décor, backdrops and décor-hanging systems, working late into the night. Some came to pre-party venue reccy missions to ensure the décor designs would fit and spent hard sweaty time pre-rigging the venue.<br /><br />Some scoured London for affordable good quality carpet or negotiated excellent rates for hire of staging. Some gave advice on fire retardant paint additives, sourced flame retardant materials, or drove around the busy city to pick up new fabrics. DJs spent hard earnt money on new tunes and rehearsed tirelessly late into the night after working all day.<br /><br />Lighting people tried out new rigging techniques, worked out power considerations and studied photos and proposed new lighting plans. Some worked on logistics, where and how can we hang these... or the door systems, the layout, the newsletter, the web site, how will the shop work, how do we lay it out…<br /><br />Some came during the rig to work for 24 hours to add their undoubted experience; their strength or their canny knack of making it look good. Many worked on the night, on the door, running the shop, long shifts as peace officers, preparing and serving fruit, changing the art canvasses or clearing rubbish.<br /><br />Some contributed their incredible talent to en-trance us all during the happenings and live appearances or worked behind the scenes working with words, wood, metal and concepts to improve the parties. Whereas one man spent hours designing beautiful new invites, almost everyone else demanded they have handfuls on them when they were out spreading the word in the weeks before!<br /><br /><div class=\"mosimage\"  style=\" float: left; margin: 5px;\" align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/gallery/20020412/01.jpg\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" border=\"0\" /><div class=\"mosimage_caption\">by Ian Hunter</div></div>Some people called and offered much needed moral support when those worrying thoughts crept in late at night or \'rallied the troops\' for the big move by calling their friends who had been promising to come - but never quite made it before…<br /><br />So that\'s some of what the Crew and Contributors do, some just recently involved, some since the early days at the Warp nearly 3 years ago. There is not one \'hired in\' resource at Planet Angel; everyone involved is a party person with a skill and a passion for what we are all trying to achieve. None of us are just \'doing it for a job\'. Planet Angel is not about \'promoters and punters\' (in fact there are 3 words we don\'t like to use at Planet Angel, \'Punters\', \'Boss\' and \'Staff\'). Planet Angel is party people creating a party for other like-minded party people. As was said recently \"good people have an enormous capacity to enjoy themselves, all you need to do is to create the right environment\" That\'s what we aim to do, a balanced environment where people can be themselves, socialise, interact, enjoy and benefit - and we are on a mission to make it permanent one day, and we will succeed, we owe it to everyone who has made Planet Angel possible as well as ourselves.<br /><br />And so, what can we say about the most important contributors of all? Those who repay the commitment of all of us crew and contributors with their support and loyalty? The Party People, who come to party, drenching the atmosphere with love, smiles and good vibes… the like-minded, dancing happy people that really make Planet Angel what it is??<br /><br />Not enough… for without you, there is no Planet Angel!<br /><br />All we can say is, as long as everyone wants to party, we will fulfil our roles to ensure that we all have a safe place to do it.<br /><br />See you on the 10th; luv n hugs Pete &amp; Angel<br /><br /><h3>Planet Angel The next Generation - Made it so! by Sash </h3><p>Can it get any better?, Could the party get any larger?, Could we have any more fun? Can I get any more short sentences in? Damn right we could. On April 12th the phenomenon of Planet Angel™ spread its wings, burst from the chrysalis it had been hiding in for a month and emerged renewed in all its vigour as a new and improved version of its former self.<br /><br />From the inception of Planet Angel™ it has always been a vision of its creators Angel and Pete that one day they would have a permanent place where the ethos and vision of like-minded , talented and giving people could share their skills and even make a living doing things they love, and as of April it is one step closer to this goal with a hugely successful re-launch in a new venue \"The Arches\" at 34 Southwark St, Nr London Bridge.<br /><br />In the month prior to the Next Generation re-launch there was a huge amount of frenetic activity in the army of support crew assisting the club and many working unpaid just doing it for the love of the club and the joy they knew they would impart to its many appreciative Party goers.<br /><br /><div class=\"mosimage\"  style=\" float: left; margin: 5px;\" align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/gallery/20020412/25.jpg\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" border=\"0\" /><div class=\"mosimage_caption\">by Ian Hunter</div></div>On the subject of the Planet Angel™ Massif this is as much about them as the organisation because there is a real sense that this is \"our\" club and not just some bland corporate organisation trying to fleece us of our ready cash with s***ty promotions and phoney attempts at appealing to the standard Marketing \"Clubber Demographic\" of 18-25 yr olds.With the PA \"No Advertising\" policy it was possible that no-one would even know that the club was moving and they wouldn\'t get the turnout needed to make the new night a success. There was a large amount of word of mouth \"Inviting\" by the Planet Angel™ regular Massif using the spectacular new invites designed by Charlie Montagnac (a very talented Graphics man) and Angel &amp; Pete were also assisted by the featuring of a full page interview in underground magazine \"Intercourse\". At the end of the day its in our interest to make the club successful to make our parties better and its this emotional investment that marks this out as something a bit different.I didn\'t know what to expect when I turned up at the venue and the excitement was almost electric waiting to see what had been produced. The door personnel were friendly enough and the queue was reasonable as I got there fairly early to get the most from the night.The first room was obviously some kind of reception area with a bar along one side wall and plenty of tables and chairs for chilling out and taking your coat off and just getting in. The cloakroom was efficient and had a plastic pass system that allowed me to pretend to be a superstar DJ later with a backstage pass(Just pretend mind! - where\'s my trolley?) . I had taken my new Djembe (A West African drum) with me because I was expecting to join in a big drumming set later in the evening…. If they had the session I missed it and didn\'t join in because I was distracted by some monster flashing lasers in the main room.<br />I spent an hour or so exploring the venue and saying \"HI!\" to lots of the regulars (Hugs all round then) , and just getting a feel for the place. Its definitely a lot bigger than the last venue and has a cleaner feel. The PA decorators had really pulled out all the stops and the place looked fantastic. From the front room you go through to the main Dance room, then the Funky breakbeat, global choons room, which much to mine an the pleasure of many happy grinning fools is now competing directly with the main room being about the same size and with some absolutely banging music. The Live Breakbeat set supplied by The Headhunters who recently supported \"The Low Fidelity Allstars\" was amazing and kicked off the room to a tee and really setting the scene for a top night and future parties.<br /><br /><div class=\"mosimage\"  style=\" float: right; margin: 5px;\" align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/gallery/20020412/19.jpg\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" border=\"0\" /><div class=\"mosimage_caption\">by Ian Hunter</div></div>I think as the Club is evolving so are a lot of the new DJ\'s playing in the club that have maybe been given their breaks there and as the club grows in stature so does their confidence and ability to read an audience really bringing out their best. I can honestly say I\'ve been really impressed with the work of One DJ I am a big fan of there and that\'s Butterfly Pete. He seems to have really turned it on in the last few months and I see him doing big stuff in the future. Don\'t get me wrong I like the other DJ\'s too but am a big fan of his style of music and the big Phat choons he plays.(thats it mate, no more hero worship just in case you can\'t get thru the door next time!)<br /><br />In the back there is another final room which is really the Chillout area whilst the other rooms have some space to chill this is really where I\'d go to kick back , cool down and grab a quiet drink. Attached to this bar is a garden area which although quite cold in April will be lovely during the summer months.<br /><br />As the evening wore on the place started to fill up and by One or Two in the morning it was totally rammed with bouncing, heaving, dancing mayhem going on in both dance rooms and all chillout areas having a healthy amount of people sprawling about and the usual activities of Painting, Jenga, Lego, playdoh and Wendalines Face Painting in evidence. It was great to see loads of new faces aswell and nice to see the pleasurable surprise on peoples faces when you said \"Hello\" and started chatting. I must say a lot of my evening is a tad hazy as after a couple of hours all the excitement and fun blends together, but for me highlights of the night have to be the Live breakbeat and new proper breakbeat room, \"The Happening\" at 3am with fresh fruit handouts and the incredible Juggling tour de force that is Feeding The Fish, seeing the place rammed with people and knowing it was a big success,(seeing the looks on Angel and Pete\'s faces what a picture), Butterfly Pete\'s set(he rocks!), and as usual spending 7 hours with some of the nicest people I know.<br /><br />Well It all happens again soon on Friday May 10th. The Latest Invites are out, another terrific design from Charlie, this time featuring an Homage to our purple fluff fairy. I\'ve started to collect them now as they\'re so good! Come along to the next party and dance your pants off.<br /><br />Big hugs n all that ……….Sash.<br /><br />Footnote: Since the publishing of the last issue of Intercourse Mandy (The Editor) has been involved in a pretty bad accident which will put everything on hold for a while.

Please feel free to use them on the Web site or whatever.<br /><br />From the darkness of a South London car park, people slowly snaked through a doorway into a backstreet club. Some have come alone, others with friends, but already any divisions between them are dissolving. Inside the ceiling and walls of the building are decorated with waves of flowing material illuminated by prisms of light; and although beyond the rainbows are bricks and mortar, people reach out to the infinity beyond; for this is Planet Angel.<br /><br />Two main rooms are filled with rhythms that urge every muscle and limb into syncopated movement; but Planet Angel is more than this. There is a quiet courtyard where old friends meet and new friendships are born, whilst all around colourful streamers flow in time with the bodies that propel them; but Planet Angel is more than this too. There are places to paint, meditate, build Lego palaces and, like the many drummers, places to find your own rhythm; but Planet Angel is still more than this.<br /><br />For Planet Angel is about its people; you, me and anybody prepared to shake off the dark cloak of what society tells us we should be, and return to our essential being ? humanity. Humanity that knows that laughter and love are our most powerful forces and humanity that understands that the symbiosis of music, light and dance raises the body into an ecstatic sensuous state.<br /><br />This is what I experienced at Julys, and my first, Planet Angel. The rhythms picked up my tired body and flung it between the two rooms, my body yearning for ever more intoxicating beats. Finally I was washed up beneath Tequila throwing his muse down at us from the decks. And it was then that I became as one with the crowd, music and joy flowing between our bodies, one amorphous mass of love. Outside the sun glared bright and the trains grumbled overhead, but as we re-entered the everyday world, inside we all remained on Planet Angel.\"<br /><br /></i></p><blockquote><i>\"I\'m sure loads of people have said what a great night it was. Because it was! It was my best one at the new venue. The reason being is that everyone finally jelled. The old and new crowd got it together and the integration made me so happy! It was a relaxed but uplifting vibe all night long. Cor and it went so fast! Pooh! Everything worked in harmony. Visually(lighting was amazing), musically (tops+ the flow of sounds cascading from one room to another) and it was like someone had tickled the crowd with a giant (obviously fluoro) pink feather!<br /><br />When I was on stage and looking down on that bouncy crowd, I was full of reconstituted energy. What a natural buzz. Moments to live for! See you soon<br /><br />A pot of golden love <br />ISSY\"<br /></i></blockquote><p><i><br />\"thankyou very much for you e-mail, ive been waiting for it since i put my name down, at the last planet angel i had the best night of my life i spent every second wandering around dowing weird s**t! It was great!i dont know how you people have done it, but you have created something that i have dreamed about for years, a place where i can stay in my own world away from reality, (i hate reality people arent nice there, bad stuf happens :-( ....). at planet angel i dont feel the need to hold back from the person i really am, and everyone else does the same, and theres no bad vibes at all! The moment you walked in the place you could only feel love!!!anyway what was i saying? yeah at the last planet angel i met so many different people it was mad, i met some lovely woman who was doing the body painting from my home town (chichester) which nobody has heard of! (that scared me slightly), i didnt know what to get painted, so i asked her to paint something that she thought i might like, she painted a dragon, which just happens to be my favourite mystical creature, and it looked so good, until i got a massage.<br />after i recieved the massage i returned the favour, he said it was the best massage he\'s had, so he told me to sit down and massage some more people, (i think he said he was a vampire?) anyway i then massaged this other bloke, who once again said it was an amazing massage, so i told him to go and tell his freinds to come and get one! I did a few more and also told them to tell there friends, (thinking they would get sidetract) and ended up doing massages for four hours! (but it was great!).<br /><br />it was an absolutly wonderful experience! thus concluding my night at planet angel! thankyou one and all i love you and all that you are!\"</i><br /></p>','','1','9','0','29','2002-07-26 00:00:00','63','','2006-03-24 17:31:24','70','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2006-03-05 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','gallery/20020614/june03.jpg|right||0|by Mark Wilkinson|bottom||','','pageclass_sfx=\r\nback_button=\r\nitem_title=1\r\nlink_titles=\r\nintrotext=1\r\nsection=0\r\nsection_link=0\r\ncategory=0\r\ncategory_link=0\r\nrating=\r\nauthor=\r\ncreatedate=\r\nmodifydate=\r\npdf=\r\nprint=\r\nemail=\r\nkeyref=\r\ndocbook_type=','4','0','6','','','0','517','the-arches-12th-july-2002');

Last year we put up a questionnaire on the website to gain feedback on a number of issues and to see what everyone had to say about the future of Planet Angel. It covered every aspect of Planet Angel including The Party and *Chilled*, but also the overall direction we\'re heading in and other exciting projects on the horizon.</P>','<P>It was a real opportunity for everyone to have their say in the future of Planet Angel and we thank everyone who took part.</P>\r\n<P>We were blown away by how many of you took the time to work through all the questions and seized the opportunity to really tell us what you think through the comments sections… (See below) there were pages and pages of comments, they were upfront, honest and to the point and helped raise awareness of stuff we can now improve, some induced spine-tingling moments of pride, and some contained simply fantastic ideas!</P>\r\n<P>Here are the key findings from the questionnaire results that we\'ll be using to keep on improving things: </P>\r\n<P><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/NewsArticles/quote1.jpg\" width=\"110\" height=\"270\" style=\"float: left;\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"Quote One\" title=\"Quote One\" border=\"0\" />Planet Angel is more than a \'rave\' or club, or a party… we\'re all part of a strong social network which is continually developing and evolving by word of mouth… so you may or may not be surprised to hear that <EM>everyone</EM> stated “the friendly people” as a reason for going to Planet Angel! “The friendly people” was also the <EM>most important</EM> reason for going, music and dancing came second along with other social stuff like meeting friends…</P>\r\n<P>In addition, 95% of those who took part said they’d benefitted from Planet Angel. This is a fantastic result because as you know <A href=\"list/about/#about_wiaa\" target=_blank mce_href=\"list/about/#about_wiaa\">one of the aims</A> is that Planet Angel is of real benefit to people: a ‘Social Profit’ as it’s called.&nbsp; The most common benefits were increased self-confidence and a larger group of friends - both of which are fundamental to increasing self-esteem, which of course everyone needs :0) Other reasons have tangible benefits with many examples of people having found the confidence to change their careers, with most moving into the voluntary/charity sectors and some saying they gained the confidence to start their own businesses. Since Planet Angel\'s officially stated aims are to make a social and environmental profit (not a financial one) this basically means it\'s doing very, very well!</P>\r\n<P>That\'s all good, however… One of the most intriguing results was about \'securing a building as a permanent home’ which as you know has always been one of Planet Angel\'s <A href=\"list/about/#about_wiaa\" target=_blank mce_href=\"list/about/#about_wiaa\">stated aims</A> since the beginning back in 1999. As it turns out, only about 50% of people (who filled in the Questionnaire) were particularly interested in the building: which was a real surprise.</P>\r\n<P>Conversely, what was loud &amp; clear, was that almost all of us (97%) are interested in an outdoor event, and around 90% want to see environmental responsibility at that event.</P>\r\n<P>We can see from the efforts of others that have done so, that securing and running a building is a massive undertaking and one that undoubtedly needs a lot of focus, commitment, resources and energy to plan it and make it work. Whilst we\'re certainly not suggesting it\'s ditched, we reckon that a building should take a back seat while we focus on what most people want: to get Planet Angel outdoors so we can all have fun in the sun and start to make an environmental profit as well as a social profit!</P>\r\n<P><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/NewsArticles/quote3.jpg\" width=\"110\" height=\"231\" style=\"float: right;\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"Quote Three\" title=\"Quote Three\" border=\"0\" />With this in mind, we\'ve started pitching to festivals for 2008 and have a few plans in the pipeline... As with the children\'s story \'The Tortoise and The Hare\' we won\'t try and run too fast, but we\'re aiming to make steady progress, not stopping until we reach the finish line :0)</P>\r\n<P>Over the coming months we’ll also be looking at other ways Planet Angel can create an Environmental Profit: as always feel free to <A href=\"community/getting-involved/\" target=_blank mce_href=\"community/getting-involved/\">get involved</A> or make some suggestions.</P>\r\n<P>As you can see your input has been absolutely invaluable in shaping the future of Planet Angel and we thank you all for playing a part in the next phase of the dream… </P>\r\n<P>Don’t worry if you didn’t get to fill in the questionnaire, we know that Planet Angel is about people and we’re going to introduce more regular questionnaires and other ways for everyone to communicate and help influence the future of Planet Angel. Onwards and upward as we say!</P>\r\n<P>With love, <A href=\"crew-and-contributors/co%11founder/pete--cofounder-20060317126/\" target=_blank mce_href=\"crew-and-contributors/co%11founder/pete--cofounder-20060317126/\">Pete</A> &amp; <A href=\"crew-and-contributors/co%11founder/angel--cofounder-20060316107/\" target=_blank mce_href=\"crew-and-contributors/co%11founder/angel--cofounder-20060316107/\">Angel</A></P>\r\n<P>And finally, here are some of the quotes about how Planet Angel has benefitted people, for a few it’s just a bit of fun, for others a temporary escape, but for the vast majority, it’s a really positive influence... </P>\r\n<P mce_keep=\"true\">&nbsp;</P>\r\n<P><STRONG><EM>“how have you benefitted from Planet Angel?”</EM></STRONG></P>\r\n<P align=center>I\'ve met friends and people that I\'ve travelled the globe with and who have changed my life. Planet became my favourite club and gave me a perfect handle on how I want social life to run. It\'s been a comfort in times of stress and family disruption, and it\'s always made me smile when I walk in. It\'s a place I can go to in my head at the drop of a hat, and it never lets me donw.<BR>~ x ~<BR>My organisational skills and confidence have improved without any shadow of a doubt. My understanding of how an organisation like Planet Angel can work in this competitive, commercial world has helped me in both my personal and working life.<BR>~ x ~<BR>It\'s given me contact with a large group of people who are all disinterested in the general world of clubbing and long for the unity felt when surrounded by so many like-minded people. For me, Planet Angel is a place I can go and dance, sing, be happy and silly, be completely outrageous [which is being myself!] and not have people come up to me a beat me up for wearing neon-orange, or for having bad hair, or for dancing like i might mean it.&nbsp; Planet Angel opened up my eyes and allowed me to see that there is hope for the human race. We\'re not all b*stards out to screw one another over, sometimes nice people are just nice people :D<BR>~ x ~<BR>you guys probably have had one of the biggest influences on my life.<BR>~ x ~<BR>In so many ways, it\'s lead me to a happier and healthier place in my personal life, and opened my eyes up to positive influences which have helped me to overcome personal demons and lead to a better job (in a charity) and to a sense of self worth and perspective in a world that can sometimes be very challenging.<BR>~ x ~<BR>life changing! My attitude towards life and being able to talk about things that were all supressed!<BR>~ x ~<BR>I\'ve built up a wonderful network of friends who have given me excellent moral support through some hard times.&nbsp; Without the Planet Angel network I\'d probably have hit the valium by now.&nbsp; It\'s also given me a great opportunity to explore my own creativity and has boosted my self confidence.&nbsp; It\'s given me a much more relaxed outlook on life and definitely keeps my stress levels down.<BR>~ x ~<BR>ive been able to act as i want not how society sees fit, its helped build my confidence and my self esteem, and i get to meet the best peeps around....<BR>~ x ~<BR>it\'s made me look differently at life. I now treat everyone the way i\'m treated at the party. Everyone is non judgemental and accepting, and i try to put this into my life.<BR>~ x ~<BR>It\'s nice to know there are like minded people<BR>~ x ~<BR>its made me a very very very confidant person....<BR>~ x ~<BR>It\'s inspiring to know that there are people who care and are passionate about what they do.&nbsp; Planet Angel has added a dimension to my life that I thought I had lost forever and that only came around once in a while before. The chance to relax and be myself and really have a good time.&nbsp; <BR>~ x ~<BR>It\'s been a social framework for making me the person I wanted to be.<BR>~ x ~<BR>It\'s changed my life. My social life. My friends. My outlook. There\'s no going back for me.<BR>~ x ~<BR>It\'s given me the opportunity to meet some genuinely remarkable people who I would no doubt not have had the honour of getting to know otherwise.<BR>~ x ~<BR>It has broadened my mind, brought me in contact with some truly amazing people, made me find myself and like myself more by giving me a safe haven once a month to just be. It has been a poignant turning point in my life!<BR>~ x ~<BR>It has given me great opportunities to progress my art, I have met many great people through it and built networks with them that have brought me business.<BR>~ x ~<BR>It helped me regain myself and my life, I found planet angel at a bad time in my life and it was the best escape for me to dance my troubles away meet loads for really great people and feel safe to go on my own and not worry about being a billy no mates as you all made me so welcome.&nbsp; It has allowed me to dress up and laugh and live and built my confidence again and help me find myself.&nbsp; It makes me smile every time I think about it.<BR>~ x ~<BR>I\'m a lot more relaxed about life and enjoy meeting such a wide cross section of like-minded people.<BR>~ x ~<BR>I\'m more confident, have met a great group of people, have developed skills working at PA that have helped me in the rest of my life.<BR>~ x ~<BR>Sorry! It\'s only a bit of fun<BR>~ x ~<BR>I walked off the dance floor after 3 hours of solid dancing with make up streaming everywhere and it was treated like the most normal thing in the world. No bitchy looks, no snide comments, just understanding smiles from those doing the same as me, totally losing it :)<BR>~ x ~<BR>Oh, come on, you know.<BR>~ x ~<BR>Another way i\'ve benefited from this amazing place is that its made me realise that even though loads of sh*t people in the world do really bad things, theres still so many wonderful warm-hearted people out there waiting for you to speak to them.<BR>~ x ~<BR>I have met some amazing people and the parties have opened up my mind to all the different and cool people that you can meet if you find the right place! People always told me Planet Angel changed them in a good way, and only when I first went did I understand why. I love it!<BR>~ x ~<BR>I have met many new friends and had some really beautiful experiences, experiences that I will no doubt remember for many years to come.<BR>~ x ~<BR>I have met new friends and have been made closer to alot of my friends around me. So i believe planet angel has had an excellent impact on my life and has made it more interesting an much more happy!!<BR>~ x ~<BR>I have friends I met at planet. Some of them are like family to me now, and many of them I only see when I am AT Planet. Just stop and think about that.. My life, my social group, the very things that I define as most important to me.. they would be different if I had not discovered The Party. I cannot say more than that.<BR>~ x ~<BR>I have learnt that there is more to life than the average clubs i used to go to...i tell people about your club all the time and all the people i have gone with wake up and feel like it was a dream!<BR>~ x ~<BR>i have made some good friends and had some brilliant experiences. i am not mad on dancing but it is cool just mucking about with new and old friends. i can definitely say i have never had a bad night and on several occasions i have turned up even when the rest of my friends couldnt make it. also i don\'t feel too old to party there as the age range is vast. i know at least 2 sets of people who are planning to be married soon.<BR>~ x ~<BR>I have become a more chilled person and have been able to talk to people a lot easier than before.<BR>~ x ~<BR>I believe everything happens for a reason, cause and effect. I can\'t imagine how my life would be without all the wonderful people I have met through Planet Angel in one way or another.<BR>~ x ~<BR>Helped me gain confidence, deal with my sexuality, come out (in the party itself actually...), met loads of friends, got a job from someone I met there, found a whole new range of music and realised that it isnt me that\'s strange...well it is but so is&nbsp; everyone else and that\'s fine :)<BR>~ x ~<BR>Helped me recognise the fact that everyone can be who they are and it is a good thing to just be.<BR>~ x ~<BR>how big is this box ;-) mainly it\'s had all kinds of lovely spin offs into my life when I\'m not at PA or chilled. I met a fantastic bunch of people, felt accepted even though I\'m \'far too old to go clubbing\', got to dance my socks off to great music and got to hear great music and find out what that great music is, made loads of friends, had several really memorable shags...only kidding, but met to date three people I\'ve had relationships with of varying lengths, laughed and laughed and laughed, been allowed to contribute, grown in confidence and cheekiness and naughtiness through caretaking and working for you, learnt a lot about myself and other people, had a haven from being too much of a responsible grown up...it\'s really enriched my life...quick! find me a tree I need to hug something!<BR>~ x ~<BR>You know why x<BR>~ x ~<BR>Great opportunity to let loose in safety and have fun without being hit on or harassed.<BR>~ x ~<BR>friends, lifestyle, out look on life, wisedom. nearly every aspect of my life. I can\'t tell you how much my life has changed for the better.<BR>~ x ~<BR>By providing a safe place to try new experiences and meet people, it\'s changed my entire outlook on life. I now work for small moments of happiness, rather than an ideal lifestyle which is a total illusion.<BR>~ x ~<BR>cos its a fat party, and something to look forward to, as well as it making it easier to meet other people.<BR>~ x ~<BR>a place to escape too<BR>~ x ~<BR>As a bedroom music producer i have had the opportunity to listen to some amazing music and then chat about with the DJs and other musically orientated people at the party - this it quite a unique experience which has improved my production skills immensely.<BR>~ x ~<BR>Yes, Planet Angel is the single best event I have ever been to.&nbsp; Thank you so much for running a party that is full of wonderful and interesting people.&nbsp; Please ensure that it is still running in years, nay, decades to come.&nbsp; Thank you Planet Angel, thank you from the bottom of my heart. xxxxxx<BR>~ x ~<BR>this questionnaire was long! made me late leaving work :)<BR>~ x ~<BR>keep going - you\'re never allowed to stop - that\'s an order ;)<BR>~ x ~<BR></P>','1','1','0','1','2007-07-24 18:57:11','64','Pete & Angel','2008-06-25 11:52:26','64','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2007-07-24 18:46:48','0000-00-00 00:00:00','NewsArticles/istock_000001132973small[300].jpg|center||0||bottom||\r\nNewsArticles/quote1.jpg|left|Quote One|0||bottom||\r\nNewsArticles/quote3.jpg|right|Quote Three|0||bottom||','','pageclass_sfx=\nback_button=\nitem_title=1\nlink_titles=\nintrotext=1\nsection=0\nsection_link=0\ncategory=0\ncategory_link=0\nrating=\nauthor=\ncreatedate=\nmodifydate=\npdf=\nprint=\nemail=\nkeyref=\ndocbook_type=','20','0','65','','','0','1129','the-future-of-planet-angel-what-you-said');

During this time I have also explored the potential of many disciplines and gleaned an insight into a variety of healing practices and energy work.<br />My aim is to assist with the self healing and empowerment of those that choose to help themselves, so that they may rebalance and realise their potential. </p>\r\n<p><b>What is Reiki?</b><br />Reiki is an ancient Japanese system of healing that utilises universal life force energy for healing purposes. This ancient technology was founded by Dr Mikao Usui in 1922 and is learned by a process of attunements which fine-tune the physical and etheric bodies to a higher vibrational level. </p>\r\n<p>It can be experienced by either hands on or off (on the aura) or distant healing. By placing the hands along the charkas or energy centres within the body, the healing energy is drawn through the practitioner by the recipient; please note this process does not drain the practitioner as the energy passes through. It travels to the areas of dis – ease that require it whilst providing an opportunity for a deep relaxation. A Reiki treatment will encourage physical, mental and emotional healing and spiritual growth, thus aiding the release of blocked energy and enabling restored well-being and renewed equilibrium.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><b>How long &amp; Why</b><br />Sometimes the beneficial effects of Reiki may be instantly noticeable, sometimes it may take a course of treatments to get to the core of dis – ease, either way regular treatments will help maintain well being, reduce stress and encourage the body’s natural healing abilities.<br />Reiki has also been used with great success on plants and animals. </p>\r\n<p><b>What will I feel?</b><br />Reiki may be experienced as a warm, tingling sensation or cool breeze. Occasionally the recipient may shiver, giggle or become tearful as the energy is released and re-aligned.<br />If you would like to experience the gentle non-invasive energy of a Reiki treatment a session will last approximately 1hour.</p>\r\n<p>1st consultation &amp; treatment £30<br />Treatments thereafter £25<br />Concessions £20 <br /><br />Teaching workshops also available. Please contact me for more details. <br />Gift vouchers available<br />Event and home group bookings welcome. <br /><br />Working from home near Rochester easily accessible by road or rail or in Greenwich SE10 on Wednesdays. </p>\r\n<p><b>Website:</b> <a href=\"http://www.indigo-star.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" mce_href=\"http://www.indigo-star.co.uk/\">http://www.indigo-star.co.uk</a></p>','1','12','0','46','2006-03-24 18:01:55','65','','2006-04-02 11:20:08','70','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2006-03-24 18:01:08','0000-00-00 00:00:00','CrewContribs/indigo star1.jpg|left||0||bottom||','','pageclass_sfx=\r\nback_button=\r\nitem_title=1\r\nlink_titles=\r\nintrotext=1\r\nsection=0\r\nsection_link=0\r\ncategory=0\r\ncategory_link=0\r\nrating=\r\nauthor=\r\ncreatedate=\r\nmodifydate=\r\npdf=\r\nprint=\r\nemail=\r\nkeyref=\r\ndocbook_type=','14','0','16','','','0','946','indigo-star');

We would watch the moon travel over us, as we danced the night away.</p>\r\n<p>I discovered in these kinds of settings, people would shed their inhibitions and share creative talents they normally reserved for the privacy of their own home. I met acrobats and learnt to balance my whole body on the soles of another person feet (and sort-of look elegant with it!), I was read incredible poems that came from the bottom of the heart, I played flute to a field full of people, through a circle of huge shell-speakers… so many fantastic experiences.</p>\r\n<p>The winters were spent indoors; clubbing seemed to fill us with a frustration factor that led to an early departure and a search for another place to have a good time. I felt what was lacking was a space in a club that was balanced and a little more realistic, where people could indulge in activities… art, games, social contact.</p>\r\n<p>After a shocking personal tragedy, I went on to lose a job that had been everything to me for 6 years following the political manoeuvring of a so-called friend… like a rolling stone gathering moss I came close to losing almost everything else as a result.</p>\r\n<p>Out of these dark days came an unstoppable drive &amp; determination to start Planet Angel with <a href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=126&amp;Itemid=127\" mce_href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=126&amp;Itemid=127\">Pete</a>.&nbsp; It was a mad dream, it was a positive focus, it was I think in the end my saviour. I set out to create a positive, safe, social environment through hosting fantastic events and creating a space for like-minded people of all ages to make connections, participate, be creative, have fun, be themselves &amp; feel comfortable… a space where the main factors in clubs - music and lights, were reigned in and balanced with other elements not normally found at these kind of events, such as art and poetry. I invested my heart and soul into the dream, because I needed this space for myself.</p>\r\n<p>We searched for other people who understood what we were creating and could contribute to the elements.

I have on the walls a large white board with a frame, put together and painted white, specifically for the purpose of painting on, writing on, sticking things on... anything really. The board is now many years old and over that time has undergone many a transformation! Photographs of it as it has evolved show a snapshot of where I was at, at that moment in time…&nbsp; it represents stages of my life, reminds me of events... my friends who’ve contributed… </p>\r\n<p>From there the idea for the canvasses (at the Parties) developed.

When i open it i recieve a whirlwind of planet angel loveliness and sunshine - so, a big thank you to anyone who helped create its special aura.

Underneath I was really just a happy go lucky musician type guy who was fascinated with electronics and loved people and parties and music and people having fun. For various reasons I had been living a life that was not right for me.</p>\r\n<p>Then my very dear friend and role model died.&nbsp; I lost it.&nbsp; Things started to unravel, and, in the process I lost some people that had been part of my life for 10 years and that I care for very much. </p>\r\n<p>I had drifted so far from my natural path in life that all I knew was to continue along the money/company/career progression thing and, although I felt lost inside, for a couple of years I continued in the business I knew best, which was IT.&nbsp; There was significant success, I was MD of a small IT company and sold it to a big city company… Big investment.. Big floatation on the horizon.. Big bucks returns and all that (this was the dot.com era).. It was all there.&nbsp; But inside I felt utterly exhausted and sad.&nbsp; I was in a bad and lonely place and ‘took my eye off the ball’.</p>\r\n<p>My business partner (and friend) used the opportunity to ‘make a few changes’ and in a flash I ended up unemployed, absolutely broke, having to fight for unfair dismissal in court, and depressed.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=107&amp;Itemid=127\" mce_href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=107&amp;Itemid=127\">Angel</a> had also been having loads of fun in her life (!), and, from that very very low point we dreamt. We dreamt of better things… We imagined a place, a gathering of like-minded people… We looked but we couldn’t find anywhere that provided what we wanted... Many purported to do so but when it came down to it, it was either ego, money or power that was the driving force…</p>\r\n<p>So we started to organise our own magical gatherings of friends; on moonlit evenings on Primrose Hill, and around the lakes where the M4 meets the M25.&nbsp; We won our unfair dismissal and put the winnings into the dream and then began – what turned out to be two years - of working in jobs we despised to raise further finance and to build momentum for the crazy dream that we called Planet Angel.&nbsp; </p>\r\n<p>It’s been a fantastic journey so far and there is so much more to be discovered...

We’ve also offered gigs to over 60 different DJs, again, some of whom had never played out before!&nbsp; We’re also pleased to note that we are one of the few events that ‘<EM>don’t</EM>’ ask DJs or bands to bring loads of people in order to get a gig!&nbsp; Planet Angel’s selection process is simple… 1.&nbsp;are they like-minded? and 2.&nbsp;do they have they the skills to deliver the music we want?</P>','<P>The result, we hope you agree, is some of the best music around played by some of the best DJs and bands around – regardless of how ‘big’ they are.</P>\r\n<P>Current Resident DJs: Dr. F, <A href=\"crew-and-contributors/djs-and-musicians/andy-cunningham-dj-nibbler-20070223321/\" mce_href=\"crew-and-contributors/djs-and-musicians/andy-cunningham-dj-nibbler-20070223321/\">Nibbler</A> and <A href=\"crew-and-contributors/djs-and-musicians/sly-one--graham-crockford-2006020629/\" mce_href=\"crew-and-contributors/djs-and-musicians/sly-one--graham-crockford-2006020629/\">Sly One</A> provide the foundations of the <A href=\"community/getting-involved/musicanddjing-2006030139/\" mce_href=\"community/getting-involved/musicanddjing-2006030139/\">music policy</A>, making sure they’re at each Party, setting the tone for the rooms and using their skills and experience to deliver brilliant sets that are right on the mark.

As part of the Music Team there are a lot of requirements on Residents, they need to know Planet Angel very very well not just musically, but also ethically, and it’s not just for the Party, there are other events like <A href=\"events/planet-angel-%2achilled%2a/\" mce_href=\"events/planet-angel-%2achilled%2a/\">*Chilled*</A> <A href=\"past-events/2006/planet-angel-rocks-review--29th-october-2006-20061102292/\" mce_href=\"past-events/2006/planet-angel-rocks-review--29th-october-2006-20061102292/\">ROCKS!</A> and <A href=\"past-events/2006/new-years-eve-2006-review-20061208309/\" mce_href=\"past-events/2006/new-years-eve-2006-review-20061208309/\">New Year’s Eve</A>. There are meetings to attend and behind the scenes stuff like reviewing demos and after the event feedback to post on the crew forum and lots more besides.</P>\r\n<P>So, it didn’t take much for the Music Team to notice that two DJs stood out amongst the plethora of brilliant DJs that perform at Planet Angel. For two years they have proven to be ultra reliable in the quality of their sets, consistently playing sets that are perfectly tuned to the vibe and the spirit of Planet Angel. They’ve also been completely professional and are as like-minded as it gets!</P>\r\n<P>So, despite a meeting to try to put them off, we are very pleased to announce that Jurrane and <A href=\"crew-and-contributors/djs-and-musicians/ade-lauge-20060830268/\" mce_href=\"crew-and-contributors/djs-and-musicians/ade-lauge-20060830268/\">Ade Laugee</A> have accepted an offer to become Planet Angel Resident DJs!</P>\r\n<P>Both played fantastic sets at the <A href=\"past-events/2007/party20070406-20070410335/\" mce_href=\"past-events/2007/party20070406-20070410335/\">last Party</A> and we can be sure to hear more from them as they join the current Residents in ensuring that the music at Planet Angel remains the best we can get.</P>\r\n<P>Welcome aboard guys!

Everyone was so nice! Never before had I felt so comfortable and able to just enjoy myself amongst people who were doing exactly the same thing. I didn\'t miss a party for about 2 years after that and then somewhere down the line someone gave me a green jacket…..I\'m now mostly to be seen wandering around as part of the hosting team or stamping your hand as you enter the night. As part of the crew here I get to meet loads and loads of you gorgeous party-goers and that second Friday of the month is, as a result, very special indeed! At no other night do I meet such warm, friendly and generally happy faces as at PA. So thanks to all of you for making my work here about as pleasurable as its possible for anything to be! </p><p>Outside the party I’m usually to be found glued to my Piano and Guitar. That’s right, I’m another one of those singer/songwriter types (currently paying the bills as a plumber) hoping one day to make (even a very teeny, tiny) living in the music industry. Music has always been a big part of my life and I’ve recently joined a band with some of the most talented people its ever been my pleasure to meet who also happen to be amongst my favourite people in the world – how cool is that? We\'re called Crossfader – watch this space! I really enjoy all genres of dance music too, as a teenager I mostly enjoyed Drum n Bass and Hardcore while since going to Planet Angel the door has opened to Trance, Breaks and allsorts of other stuff.&nbsp;</p><p>I very much also enjoy spinning my Staff and I learned to fire-breathe last summer. Always lots fun to be had at outdoor parties and in parks during the warm months spinning with people. The talent that exists out there for activities like this, juggling (which I have also recently taken up) Poi and Devilsticks is truly astounding. Going to Planet Angel has also resulted in me becoming a VJ and producing/mixing visuals at many other events alongside Jamie Stickman (another PA regular and all round nice bloke.) We have travelled all over the country and gigged at lot of different events. VJing is fantastic fun and has given me experience working on the production of a wide range of very different events and venues from the main room of the SE1 to the Origin stage at the Glade. Both of which look pretty special from onstage at 4am i can tell you.....</p><p>Festivals are a favourite part of the year for me – Glastonbury is a regular trip and I’ve been lucky enough to enjoy excursions to the Glade, V, Reading and a host of others in the past. Other parties I enjoy include Psytrance nights like Synergy and Tribe of Frog while nights such as Knowwhere and Fabric are also always worth a look. Basically, I’ll go play anywhere that looks like a giggle! I like to be able to use the skills I\'ve learned to good effect and as such, have been doing welfare at festivals and other events for the past couple of years too – it\'s really fulfilling to actually be able to input into peoples enjoyment like that, and its good experience for when we get the building!</p><p>So that’s about it from me. Please do feel free to come and chat to me at the parties or at *chilled* - Failing that, drop me an email, I’m always ready for a chat about any random old thing...music, clothes, hamsters, whatever! &nbsp;See you all on the dancefloor!</p>','1','12','0','46','2006-03-24 18:33:02','65','','2006-05-20 10:54:44','70','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2006-03-24 18:30:21','0000-00-00 00:00:00','CrewContribs/arifstaff small.jpg|left||0||bottom||','','pageclass_sfx=\r\nback_button=\r\nitem_title=1\r\nlink_titles=\r\nintrotext=1\r\nsection=0\r\nsection_link=0\r\ncategory=0\r\ncategory_link=0\r\nrating=\r\nauthor=\r\ncreatedate=\r\nmodifydate=\r\npdf=\r\nprint=\r\nemail=\r\nkeyref=\r\ndocbook_type=','17','0','15','','','0','1102','arif');

That was my first party.... The next month I did a Happening (on the marimba). </p>','<p><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/CrewContribs/beccyboo.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"200\" style=\"float: right;\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" border=\"0\" />July \'02 I started crewing and rigging; and blimey, I haven\'t looked back since... Like many people I feel PA is my home and simply can\'t imagine life without it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Luckily I don\'t have to, my path is so utterly interweaved with Planet Angel on so many levels that I couldn\'t escape even if I wanted to; but you\'re reading this website so I guess you\'d know all about that ;0)</p>\r\n<p>er, not the not escaping bit, I meant the being into PA bit. Moving on.</p>\r\n<p>Like most people around here, music is my passion. It\'s what I\'ve done all my life and I wouldn\'t ever want to be without it. Also, like many people here I\'ve had the joy of being able to share it with others, being from jamming at parties, to producing tunes, to singing, to dancing, to playing piano, to playing at festivals... yadda yadda yadda... you get the picture. Music isn\'t half so fun when you\'ve got no-one to share it with and I count my lucky stars every day that I have my friends to share it with me.</p>\r\n<p>I guess the thing most people at PA know me for is being in the dance and percussion show STOMP! For many years it had been an ambition of mine, and after graduating from Trinity College of Music in 2002 I auditioned for it. Knowing I had the love and support of this lot, made the auditions all the easier to get through, and was proud to mention PA in my programme notes when I got into the West End cast.&nbsp;After finishing STOMP! I did a collabiration with the dynamic percussion group BangOn culminating in another Happening at PA. </p>\r\n<p>After that I joined Orchid Star, a global dance music band set up by Pete Ardron (another PA person/DJ) and yes, you guessed it, we performed at PA. However, we also found time to fit in a few other gigs, the highlight being Glastonbury 2005. We have just finished recording our new album (The Birth of the Orchid Star) and are busy gigging. We\'re not available for weddings or Bat Mitzvahs but definitely for clubs wanting good live global music :0)</p>\r\n<p>I\'ve also recently done some recording for the BBC, and in between all of this (just like any self respecting musician) I do some teaching. Luckily for me, lots of my pupils are also PA people so it never really feels like work. </p>\r\n<p>In case you think I don\'t have a life outside if PA - I do - honest! In my spare time I work for a charity called Send A Cow, and like flower pressing and hill climbing. Ok, maybe not the last 2, but check out Send A Cow...</p>\r\n<p>At parties you\'ll mostly find me organising or dancing, I\'ll be the one in pink.

It was like a different world. I loved partying there and was soon a regular. </p>','<p><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/CrewContribs/pollymyatt.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"200\" style=\"float: right;\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" border=\"0\" />I am now a member of the crew dealing with the door, the shop and helping the party to function. I also rig and de-rig which is hard work but rewarding.</p>\r\n<p>My friends and I met at uni and soon started going out to various trance nights and drum and bass events. It wasn\'t long before we made it to what would be our first Planet angel. For me, that was it. I felt so comfortable there. It showed me that there were friendly, genuine people around. What I mean is that I felt safe. This enabled me to relax into my previously hidden self. I can safely say it helped me to change my life!</p>\r\n<p>Whilst partying I started looking around me and wondering how it all worked so I asked about how I could get involved and shortly after, I was a caretaker (a volunteer who’s aim it is to spread the planet angel vibe). Not long after that I joined the crew and have been doing that since August 2003. I also do the rig and de-rig and the buzz from helping to create the beautiful world that we party in is indescribable. </p>\r\n<p>Outside of PA, I’m well and truly in the fourth and final year of my classical performance degree on the ‘Cello at Trinity College of Music. Out of uni I play&nbsp; ‘cello with Arif and Indigo who both host at the parties. They write and sing their own material and Arif also does covers of various people. I love this aspect of my cello playing. I find that I enjoy the cello a lot more when I’m away from the pressure of college work.</p>\r\n<p>My aims in life became clear after doing a series of workshops as part of my degree course with a group of special needs children. I realised that I wanted my career to be in Music Therapy. My ultimate dream which I’ve had for a year or so is to create a retreat which offers various types of creative therapy and holistic health to people with depression, handicaps or are suffering from long term illness. </p>\r\n<p>At the moment I’m in the process of advertising private tuition (see the classifieds section on the Nov/Dec newsletter) and will start tutoring on a regular wind chamber music course in October at Benslow Music Trust. Check my website for more info and a chance to listen to me playing. </p>\r\n<p><b>Website:</b> <a href=\"http://www.pollymyatt.com/\" target=\"_blank\" mce_href=\"http://www.pollymyatt.com/\">http://www.pollymyatt.com</a></p>','1','12','0','46','2006-03-24 19:13:09','65','','2006-03-30 21:57:34','70','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2006-03-24 19:12:18','0000-00-00 00:00:00','CrewContribs/pollymyatt.jpg|right||0||bottom||','','pageclass_sfx=\r\nback_button=\r\nitem_title=1\r\nlink_titles=\r\nintrotext=1\r\nsection=0\r\nsection_link=0\r\ncategory=0\r\ncategory_link=0\r\nrating=\r\nauthor=\r\ncreatedate=\r\nmodifydate=\r\npdf=\r\nprint=\r\nemail=\r\nkeyref=\r\ndocbook_type=','9','0','12','','','0','1011','polly-myatt');

As part of the Event Management team I developed my organisational skills and flexed my event management muscles in an environment that I love.</p>\r\n<p>Ever since I put on my first big party at the University of Bath back in 1996 I\'ve been passionate about event organisation. My biggest project was an entire university freshers\' week for 1500 people over 9 nights in 4 venues, but no matter what the scale or style of event, I\'m most at home when I\'m organising things. Whether it\'s a summer music festival in Ascot, dance parties with the Nuclear Bunnies, or a duck race down the river Avon (don\'t ask), I enjoy nothing more than getting entirely stressed for several weeks in the run up to a spectacular party and then seeing it all come together on the night. </p>\r\n<p>I also love to write, anything from reviews for the underground dance magazines Atom Bomb Bubble Gum and Intercourse (under the guise of Little Miss Randy) to a dissertation on the antagonistic activity of soil borne fungi (no, really!). At Planet Angel I wrote the monthly crew news and the Planet Angel Newsletter that lets everyone know what\'s going on between parties. Like everyone at Planet Angel, I\'m also passionate about music. As a dyed-in-the-wool indie kid it wasn\'t until I met DJ Tequila in 2000 that I was exposed to the joys of almost every type of dance music imaginable - I couldn\'t believe what I\'d been missing! I have stayed true to my roots, though. </p>\r\n<p>In the summer of 2001 I dusted off my cello and joined a gorgeous little acoustic band called Frodo Freud. It\'s a fantastic outlet for my creative urges and has given me the opportunity to put 10 years\' classical training to good use and make some beautiful sounds with some truly talented musicians. We\'ve recorded two CDs (which was very exciting!) but I get the biggest buzz when we play live to an appreciative audience. </p>\r\n<p>So- if you\'re looking for a session cellist, some acoustic indie sounds or need some help organising an event then I\'m your girl! (I\'m also quite an authority on soil borne fungi…).</p>\r\n<p>You\'ll find me bouncing around with a big smile - catch me if you can! </p>','1','12','0','46','2006-03-24 19:19:56','65','','2006-04-18 17:29:21','70','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2006-03-24 19:19:24','0000-00-00 00:00:00','CrewContribs/sophie.jpg|right||0||bottom||','','pageclass_sfx=\r\nback_button=\r\nitem_title=1\r\nlink_titles=\r\nintrotext=1\r\nsection=0\r\nsection_link=0\r\ncategory=0\r\ncategory_link=0\r\nrating=\r\nauthor=\r\ncreatedate=\r\nmodifydate=\r\npdf=\r\nprint=\r\nemail=\r\nkeyref=\r\ndocbook_type=','12','0','13','','','0','1378','sophie-randles');

We write and deliver upfront\r\nprogressive to blistering trance tuneage as witnessed at the Planet\r\nAngel Party, Friday 13th Sept last year. Bio music is all about the organic process, letting things flow rather than trying to actively mould our music into a predetermined shape. We strongly believe that everything happens for a reason and that reason is music! Ok so we\'re obsessed.We began writing at the end of 2001 and spent the whole winter locked away in our studio creating the Bio sound - deep progressive vibes mixed with upfront trance euphoria, the kind of music which is equally at home on your stereo or in the meltdown room at peaktime. Pete Angel called it intelligent music - we like him!<br /><br />Our first live PA proper was at Planet Angel on the anything\'s gonna happen date of Friday 13th September 2002 which for us was undoubtedly the highlight of our year. We loved the vibe of the party and we played a set which progressed to a blistering finale - if only every hour could be like that one!Luckily, the set was recorded and in the following month it was synergetically decided to release the recording complete with crowd as a cd and that\'s how Planet Angel Records was born.<br /><br />Musically both Ade and myself (especially) are extremely difficult to please and will rant for hours over things which displease us about the current music scene. I guess we\'ll always feel precious about what\'s happening to the scene and the lack of intelligence out there in the industry and on the average dancefloor these days - that\'s why we love Planet Angel so much as it encompasses many of our own ideals.<br /><br />We\'ve both been in this game a long time since the birth of rave (and before).

Take a look at the projections in the \'chill out room\' or the photo\'s on the Planet Angel website and you\'ll see what I mean. The visual feast that awaits Planet Angel partygoers is also a feast for my camera and I. The excellent lighting set-up means I rarely have to use flash, making the pictures more natural looking and give a sense of movement. </p>\r\n<p>I tend to specialise in Festivals, Protests and Club photography. I am the staff photographer for SQUALL magazine (<a href=\"http://www.squall.co.uk/\" mce_href=\"http://www.squall.co.uk/\">www.squall.co.uk</a>) An alternative news and culture website Normally seen in the alternative festivals in the form of an old Army tent, cocktail bar and eclectic music on the sound system. </p>\r\n<p>I enjoy landscape photography also and use different films and processes to get unusual effects. One such film is \'Infra Red\' The self portrait at the top is taken on this medium, the colour version of the film is even better it turns grass bright red ! </p>\r\n<p>I have started the journey into web design with designing my own website I am currently teaching myself other web related computer software packages, looking into the \'Interactive\' web and CD market. I am looking for like-minded people to join me in this venture so ring, or E-mail me if you are interested. </p>\r\n<p>I am also available for commissions, so If you are looking for a photographer or know someone who is, and are looking for a result that is a bit different from the norm, then please get in touch. </p>\r\n<p>I\'m always happy to talk about Photography, Music, DJ\'ing, Organising Festivals... so come and grab me! </p>\r\n<p><b>Website:</b> <a href=\"http://www.ianhunterphoto.com/\" target=\"_blank\" mce_href=\"http://www.ianhunterphoto.com/\">www.ianhunterphoto.com</a> </p>','1','12','0','48','2006-03-24 21:41:18','65','','2006-03-30 21:55:12','70','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2006-03-24 21:40:44','0000-00-00 00:00:00','CrewContribs/ian hunter.jpg|left||0||bottom||','','pageclass_sfx=\r\nback_button=\r\nitem_title=1\r\nlink_titles=\r\nintrotext=1\r\nsection=0\r\nsection_link=0\r\ncategory=0\r\ncategory_link=0\r\nrating=\r\nauthor=\r\ncreatedate=\r\nmodifydate=\r\npdf=\r\nprint=\r\nemail=\r\nkeyref=\r\ndocbook_type=','10','0','4','','','0','1569','ian-hunter');

I\'d draw for everyone at school and went onto complete an art A-level, art Foundation, and graduated with a BA Hons degree in ceramics. I then went into floristry, which is a strong passion of mine to this day I\'m a freelance florist covering all aspects of floristry, particularly creative bridal work.</p>\r\n<p>Over the years I\'ve taken on lots of commission work from fixing broken statues to stencilling walls and painting massive watercolour scenes. I once worked for a toy factory painting models for TV adverts, toy fairs and photo shoots… during my time there I worked on Action Man, as well as models for the film \'Toy Soldiers\'.</p>\r\n<p>One memorable private commission involved making up examples of Egyptian pots for a TV advert. I had to make the pots on a clay wheel, dry them, decorate them with small sculptures, press mould hieroglyphics onto them and paint them and of course they had to be flawless - 1000 pots in five days!! Naturally I lost loads of sleep as I churned them out, surrounded by drying pots while I smoked mountains of fags. This experience really made me realise what I can achieve!</p>\r\n<p>I\'ve taught ceramics privately to young students, and also taught at the Kaleidoscope rehab centre. Now I manage a well-known art shop, which sometimes makes me feel like I\'m leading a double life especially after a good weekend! I enjoy it and it puts me in the position of knowing just about every type of art material there is, as well as its best application.</p>\r\n<p>To sum myself up I\'d say I\'m a Ceramicist, Painter and Florist, loving every minute of clay sculpture, 3D model making, pottery, watercolours and acrylic painting. I\'d love to own a retail shop, selling my own handmade, individual gifts, with a workshop out back and my own kilns to fire!</p>\r\n<p>I can come up with creative designs, give feedback on ideas and offer a whole range of skills if you ask me, 9 times out of 10 I\'ll be able to achieve your requests with versatility, friendliness and an open mind. So feel free to get in touch and we\'ll go from there…!</p>\r\n<p>I\'m quite known at Planet Angel; you\'ll usually find me going mental armed with glowsticks, feathered fans or anything funky I can wave around... I\'ll look forward to seeing you there!</p>','1','12','0','48','2006-03-25 14:06:00','65','','2006-03-30 21:56:53','70','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2006-03-25 14:05:13','0000-00-00 00:00:00','CrewContribs/nina.jpg|right||0||bottom||','','pageclass_sfx=\r\nback_button=\r\nitem_title=1\r\nlink_titles=\r\nintrotext=1\r\nsection=0\r\nsection_link=0\r\ncategory=0\r\ncategory_link=0\r\nrating=\r\nauthor=\r\ncreatedate=\r\nmodifydate=\r\npdf=\r\nprint=\r\nemail=\r\nkeyref=\r\ndocbook_type=','6','0','3','','','0','859','nina-aka-ninja');

I didn’t go clubbing, it wasn’t my thing, but my mate Debbie persuaded me that this party was different, that it had the vibe of a big house party and that I would love it. Well, she was right. Due to work commitments, I wasn’t able to go again until March 2005, when I had just changed jobs, and was looking for a challenge. Thanks to a film about how Planet Angel is put together, which was shown as The Happening, I decided there and then that I wanted to be part of it. <BR><BR>','<img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/CrewContribs/samwyepa042edit300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"434\" style=\"float: right;\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"sam wye photo\" title=\"sam wye photo\" border=\"0\" />I started by rigging, and I soon started working front of house as well, manning the till and the shop and so on. When Polly got a job that meant she wasn’t able to work every party any more, I took over her role looking after the rigging team – ordering dinner for them, and checking all the equipment went back in the right boxes at the end of the night. When we moved venues, our crewing structure changed too, and I had a bit of a break, by working just front of house, which meant fewer hours. This was great for me, but I wanted to do something else for Planet Angel as well – but what?<BR><BR>That’s when the role of Shop Coordinator was suggested and I went for it. I really enjoy looking for new things to sell, and managing what is already there. But I was still looking for a new challenge, so I learnt to host as well, and now I’m one of the Head Hosts as well. So within 18 months, I have had five different roles to fulfil. And I love it!<BR><BR>Through the party, I have met the most amazing people. My views on life have changed dramatically. I have discovered my self-worth and a confidence in myself I never thought possible.

Went for the first time and I can\'t see me missing another one in a long long time. So many lovely people, such a great atmosphere and Jenga!!!! I had some beautiful moments I will never forget.&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P align=center>&nbsp;</P>\r\n<P align=center>I went to a planet agent event last year and loved it, since that time I\'ve not been and have lost touch with some australians who had invited me down there, loved every minute of the event and would love to experience the vibe as a way of renewing my spirit </P>\r\n<P align=center>&nbsp;</P>\r\n<P align=center>dear PA, i must regretfully unsubscibe from your service now that i currently and for the forseeable future, reside in australia.&nbsp; i applaude your past, present and future efforts in partying by bringing together people in the wonderful environment that you continually construct and maintain. </P>\r\n<P align=center>&nbsp;</P>\r\n<P align=center>Heard about through a guy I\'d made friends with the Friday before! Amazing - the whole opulent, decadent beauty of the place and the way in which everybody behaves creates the most amazing atmosphere - I want to work here and be a part of this. Truly amazing. </P>\r\n<P align=center>&nbsp;</P>\r\n<P align=center>Planet Angel is one of the most incredible places I\'ve ever been to. I had no idea that there were people out there who thought like that and hated the commercial clubs as much as I do! Coming to Planet Angel is like slipping into a favourite jumper, reassuring, cosy and warm... </P>\r\n<P align=center>&nbsp;</P>\r\n<P align=center>Looking forward to the next PA!!! - I had a dream the other night that the venue you guys used burnt down during another event and PA was no more : ( It was a sad day indeed...but then I woke up...so it\'s all good. </P>\r\n<P align=center>&nbsp;</P>\r\n<P align=center>I was discussing my philosophies and what I’d like to do in the world with a newly acquainted creative person, He replied with \" You sound like Planet Angel\" He then went on to explain his experience at Planet Angel and how wonderful it was. I’d never heard of it before and was intrigued. I went home and looked Planet Angel up on the Internet and I was/am so excited by all that I found. As I poured over every page and was constantly delighted by the creativity, positive prose and electric energy; my mind was buzzing and my heart felt happy. I am so pleased and inspired by my readings about Planet Angel’s beginnings, it’s growth and how Planet Angel has touched so many people in positive ways. I hope the good continues with grandiose outcomes. Thank you. </P>\r\n<P align=center>&nbsp;</P>\r\n<P align=center>PA is the best thing since sliced bread! nowhere else do you get an experience like it!!! </P>\r\n<P align=center>&nbsp;</P>\r\n<P align=center>I had a really brilliant off-the-scale indescribable time</P>\r\n<P align=center>&nbsp;</P>\r\n<P align=center>A really positive way to spread peace, love and respect and to get people having fun and open their minds</P>\r\n<P align=center>&nbsp;</P>\r\n<P align=center>You are continuing a noble tradition which would otherwise die off and then no-one would know that its possible to come together at a party and be creative</P>\r\n<P align=center>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>\r\n<P align=center>Love the message from the website. My partner is moving down south soon and I hope to follow so we\'ll be looking for new places and people to chill with esp as its been a hard time lately. Hope you can pass on info on parties and events. I\'m finishing a masters degree (mature student in Manchester) in an environmental subject so really hoping to use my experience and understanding - would love to meet like minded souls and see what direction it takes me.&nbsp; hope things are working out for everyone at your end and good luck for the future. </P>\r\n<P align=center>&nbsp;</P>\r\n<P align=center>good vibe from all of the info on the site and a really friendly response to my email enquiry. Really looking forward to meeting everyone and hope I\'m able to contribute in some way soon.

Well, my wonderful girlfriend Anna sums me up perfectly by saying that my brain is split into two halves. One half food, the other half music. Conveniently, I have found myself in a role within Planet Angel where I get to satisfy at least the music half of my brain.</p>','<p>After spending my formative years growing up on a diet of mum’s cooking, music, rugby and fresh air in my hometown of Pontypridd, then leaving to live in Spain and Manchester, I returned home where I become a plastic moulding engineer. After a massive change in my life, centred around a very painful and bitter divorce, I ended up in London in 1997 with my heart set on becoming the best pub manager in the world. If not the world, then the magical kingdom of Greenwich. One day in late 2001, a chap called Rolo walked past my pub and heard me blasting out trance at 3pm on a Saturday afternoon. It turned out that he was sharing a house with one of my barstaff, Kiwi Tom. He told me of this amazing place called Planet Angel and despite my initial reservations about it, we never the less forged a strong and lasting friendship.</p>\r\n<p>So, after about 6 months of regular badgering from the aforementioned Rolo, I found myself on the balcony of the Spitz bar at Planet Angel *Chilled* in March of 2002. Rich Morley (DJ U-4-IC), Planet Angel’s first and inspirational Music Coordinator, then played “Enlightenment” by The Photon Project and in that moment, it all clicked into place. My first Party was Planet Angel’s first one at the Arches in April 2002. I regularly attended the parties for a couple of years, making new friends and having some unbelievable times, then it all went a bit “mad”.</p>\r\n<p>In 2004 Rich decided that he wanted to take a well earned break and as such the position of Music Coordinator became available. Unsure at first that I could fill the gap left by such a legendary figure and music authority, I met up with Pete &amp; Angel. After a period of getting to know each other, we discovered that we had a lot in common and I realised that it would be stupid of me to miss out on such a fantastic opportunity. After a couple of months of finding out how it all worked and meeting the crew, I took up the role in April 2004. We’ve been through some good times as well as some bad times, but the theme that runs through every element of Planet Angel is that we go through them with dignity and most importantly, we go through them together. </p>\r\n<p>And that’s the main reason I’m proud to be involved with this organisation, the feeling of togetherness in the things that we achieve as a whole. You the party people, the crew, the DJ’s, me, and everybody else that turns up on the night or works tirelessly behind the scenes. Together, having fun and not caring what anybody else thinks. Celebrating being yourself!</p>\r\n<p>I’m always looking for new music, so if you’ve got anything you want me to hear, or would like to recommend something to me, please get in touch - I’m all ears. Well, half ears really. The other half is thinking about pie or cake or some other tasty morsel. And there’ll always be a bit of me thanking Rolo for being a pest. So thanks a lot mate.

I had been commuting from Birmingham for the events since 2002, where I had run into a number of musical influences such as DJ\'s U-4-IC, Monkey Pilot , Sly One, B-fly, Therapy &amp; Tequila.&nbsp;</p>','<img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/CrewContribs/paygan.jpg\" width=\"202\" height=\"145\" style=\"float: right;\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" border=\"0\" />Along with playing some Planet Angel favourites, a sprinkling of mainstream chill-out and some cheeky dubs, I’ve tried to bring more mystical, spiritual elements to the chill rooms. I use foreign instruments, ethnic voices and electronica to form a delicate blend of compositions by various musicians from around the globe.<br /><br />I generally avoid long tunes and anything that sits still for too long and try to involve as many enchanting melodies as I can in my sets. I’m not afraid of toe-tapping beats in the Chill Bar, or promoting the artists I play. Artists such as Banco de Gaia, Le Cod Afrique, Joi, Amethystium, Transglobal Underground, Pete Ardron, Ikarus, Delerium, Conjure One, Wendy G define my own style and their ethno-ambience aims to enhance the mood and encourage opportunity for more intimate conversation. I also welcome the occasional appropriate request, so if you know a chill-out tune you’d love to hear at Planet Angel, let me know, I’ll even try to work it into my set when you’re around!<br /><br />I’ve recently moved to London, within a few miles from The Party Venue and my life over the last few years reads like a dream advert for Planet Angel. I’ve met a wonderful fiancée, Mazz, developed a close community of friends throughout the city. After seeing the world on an expense account in export sales, I recently jumped ship to work in graphic design, marketing and IT – a more creative than capitalist field.<br /><br />Oh, and why PAYGAN? It’s how I thought you spelled PAGAN when I was a kid! I would have been right if only I’d been born in the 15th century, when it was spelled with the ‘Y’! It was the name of my Aunt’s horse, and an internet handle for years but lately I draw a lot of comparisons and connections between the life I lead and the music I play with that outside civilisation, outside the mainstream, outside religion and the structure such institutions place on our lives. Also with the sense of community that has developed in my life and that of pagan communities in the past. In developing Planet Angel as a new type of creative, community experience, and through the internet perhaps we are pushing the cutting edge of community in the modern world, but still using methods and practices not far from those our ancestors used in their lives.','1','12','0','47','2006-03-30 22:18:54','70','','2006-03-30 22:21:31','70','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2006-03-30 22:16:26','0000-00-00 00:00:00','CrewContribs/paygan.jpg|right||0||bottom||','','pageclass_sfx=\r\nback_button=\r\nitem_title=1\r\nlink_titles=\r\nintrotext=1\r\nsection=0\r\nsection_link=0\r\ncategory=0\r\ncategory_link=0\r\nrating=\r\nauthor=\r\ncreatedate=\r\nmodifydate=\r\npdf=\r\nprint=\r\nemail=\r\nkeyref=\r\ndocbook_type=','2','0','12','','','0','955','dj-paygan');

And we’ve ordered an EIGHT FOOT white balloon from America (they cost fortunes!) as a centrepiece, to be surrounded by the smaller bright white balloons with lights focused on them slowly changing colour..</p>\r\n<p>In the Meltdown Room we redesigned the layout of décor and discussed ideas for projections at the front of the room either on balloons or swaying chiffon curtains, the huge UV circular tabs on each wall with UV darts coming out from them along the walls on each side.&nbsp; Keep the UV collection of butterflies at the back, and bring in UV strip lights for along each wall and a cannon pointing at the butterflies at the back, away from the front where the projections may be.&nbsp; We also ordered loads and loads of UV tape &amp; hoops to make some twirling UV ceiling hangings. As ever these ‘simple ideas’ are never quite that simple, Pete spent all day making those UV hanging things!</p>\r\n<p>We reckoned the Chill Bar needs transforming as it’s too dark &amp; stark for Planet Angel… we’re going to find ways of making images of beauty and warmth to cover the walls downstairs…&nbsp; it’s quite a big idea and will cost the most so we’ll try to do a few each month over the next few months.&nbsp; We ordered some stretchy fabric to create a ceiling effect under the lighting bars on the right hand side where you sit at the Plasticene table to project oil wheels onto and create a cosy area. Upstairs we’ve changed the layout of the craft table and carpet to suit better and try to prevent the gangway getting blocked by bums.&nbsp; </p>\r\n<p>We sorted a fan for the cubby hole and replaced the (hot) light fittings with lights that don’t’ get hot, (Doh) and though about covering the black ceiling with white &amp; fairly lights to make it brighter &amp; cosier.The idea for the Garden was a ceiling of random translucent white fabric that blows in the breeze and brushes the tops of heads to project images &amp; oil wheels onto, to make this a really inviting space to sit &amp; chat as the weather turns to warm… Humm… sounds simple.</p>\r\n<p>The production team had a few new members for this month which normally means things take a bit longer, but all being well... and pending all the deliveries arrive in time, should make a pretty good start anon making ourselves at home at the new venue :0)</p>\r\n<p>And now… we’re about to start confirming Artists, Crew and all things Party Party Party!</p>\r\n<p>Here\'s a list of stuff we coud use a hand with! </p>\r\n<p>PRODUCTION - THINGS WE NEED HELP WITH. </p>\r\n<p>Making UV Twirling Ceiling hangings for main room – on the day of – or before - the April Party</p>\r\n<p>Spray Painting the connect 4 set - we’ll provide spray paint – John needs to repair a broken bit of wood on it first, so after this party</p>\r\n<p>Drawing black lines on the butterflies – with a marker pen (if anyone’s up for taking one home with a marker pen it really is the kind of thing u can do in front of the TV)</p>\r\n<p>Sanding down (&amp; waxing) the Jenga set</p>\r\n<p>Turning a list of quotes into new inspirations cards for the board</p>\r\n<p>Researching online for those bottle holders you clip to your belt</p>','1','1','0','54','2006-04-07 19:09:20','64','Angel & Pete','2006-08-27 15:49:38','70','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2006-04-07 19:00:04','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','','pageclass_sfx=\r\nback_button=\r\nitem_title=1\r\nlink_titles=\r\nintrotext=1\r\nsection=0\r\nsection_link=0\r\ncategory=0\r\ncategory_link=0\r\nrating=\r\nauthor=\r\ncreatedate=\r\nmodifydate=\r\npdf=\r\nprint=\r\nemail=\r\nkeyref=\r\ndocbook_type=','6','0','11','','','0','1049','blog-7th-april-2006');

It lasts for 3 or 4 days and we start it a couple of days after the party. We both hate doing it! </p>\r\n<p>It is also at about this time we get the most activity inbound… from wallets left in cabs, to coats left in cloakrooms, to people wanting to join the crew/ juggle/ DJ…&nbsp; and then there’s feedback on things we can improve…&nbsp; we need a snagging meeting with the venue, the web site guestbook needs attention, several hundred (literally) emails arrive - most with a required action by one of us. On top of all this, this time Pete went to the venue with the van on Tuesday to take all the kit back to the warehouse (which had been closed at the weekend coz of the bank holiday)… Everything is shouting for attention all at the same time..&nbsp; Pete has to handle most of it ‘cause I’m busy tying up the finances. </p>\r\n<p>Once the party accounts are done, by either the Thursday after the party or the Friday depending on how many problems we’ve encountered along the way, we start on the debrief stuff… venue snags, feedback and stuff on the crew forum, calling new crew &amp; volunteers to see how it went, chatting to coordinators, sorting out all the comments in the red books &amp; notes/ shopping lists for next time etc… we try to be quite thorough and read and respond to everything so this can take another couple of days to sort out and often feeds into the following week.&nbsp; </p>\r\n<p>Maybe this’ll give you an insight into why it looks like we’ve gone quiet on the Crew Forum after the party!!&nbsp;&nbsp;It\'s the effect the Party has on things!&nbsp;&nbsp; Angel gets a bit stressed out about the pressure to respond to posts on the Crew Forum sometimes, wanting to make sure everyone feels listened to and responded to - yet being too busy to - is very uncomfortable for her…</p>\r\n<p>Moan over!… as everyone knows we’re on a mission here and all of this ‘tying up the Party’ stuff is part of taking things to the next level. It must be done.&nbsp; We would appreciate it if everyone could accept a kinda ‘no post from us’ period the week after the Party… it’s not that we can’t maybe read some posts, take a phone call or deal with one-off important issues, (we are available!) but we can’t get generally distracted until we’ve wrapped up.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\r\n<p>That just leaves time to say what a brilliant Party!&nbsp; There are as ever snags to resolve (which we can get through over the next week or two) but overall excellent!

Well to begin with whoever thought that July was going to be a bit of a quiet one including me, HOW WRONG WERE WE! The Party was packed, so many new wonderful people and the regular faces! Anyway a review, we got there earlier than normal because my sister had volunteered to paint a few faces for a couple \'o\' hours as so to add to the fun, it was her first time and I do believe that many people were pleased to have uv patterns on their face. Then [in the Meltdown Room] the music kicked off with an absolutely storming debut set from John Bentley, it was great to see new DJ\'s chucking out some tunes it was also great to see that Sly One would be bringing us into land again, oh yeah! </p>\r\n<p>The most amazing part of Planet Angel for me is that no matter how many times you go there is always something new to discover, something different to play with, someone different to sit down and chat with or some different tunes to go and bounce to and this month was no different, I became a Fruit Person!! I had never had a go before, usually because I\'m dancing in the Meltdown Room and time doesn\'t exist in the Meltdown Room, but I found myself at 3am in the upstairs Chill Bar chatting to Julian and Katie (I think, hope you come back again guys!) right next to the fruit so what the hey, lets give it a go! I highly reccomend being a fruit person to anyone, it\'s a top fun laugh, you get to meet LOADSA people and nibble on the fruit as you go round, remember GRAPES ARE YOUR FRIEND! I had some lovely chats with people all night, which is strange for me because I usually go into the Meltdown room coming out for the drink occassoinally, but this is beauty of Planet Angel you can have whatever Party you want, whether dancing all night to top tunes or sitting and talking to great people.</p>\r\n<p>The night now begins to get a little hazy, I remember a lot of smiling faces as usual at PA, outstanding moments that I think happened included; a guy who I see at PA reguralary who I thought was at Glade, held up his wrist with the Glade wristband on, at which point we both just laughed! That is how much Planet Angel means to everyone, muchos pats on back for you sir! Catching Fasten Your Seatbelts in the Funky Lounge, me and my sister having a balloon outside, dancing to Joyride with the greatest and happiest people I have ever met in the Meltdown room and all the other parts in between.</p>\r\n<p>July\'s Party was amazing because I felt that I had completly toured Angel, I experienced all the rooms, had chats, danced, handed out fruit, had my face painted, danced some more, made new friends, met old friends and even though we arrived at about 10pm and stayed all night, WHERE DID THE EIGHT HOURS GO? They all just dissappeared in a blink of an eye! And as ever with Planet Angel I know there is something else hiding in a uv lit corner waiting for me just to discover it!</p>\r\n<p>So there\'s my review, hope you enjoy it but really, honestly I can\'t do justice to what the Party is in words, you have to go and experience it! So stop reading and join the mailing list!</p>\r\n<p>Of course to Pete, Angel, the fantabulous Crew and contributors, the party people and everyone involved a huge big THANKYOU!!!!!!!</p>\r\n<p>Fras</p>\r\n<h3>Submit YOUR Reviews! </h3><p>The week after the party ends we want YOU to submit your reviews of the party… the best one will be published on the website along with the party photos for all to see - and the writer of the chosen review gets free entry to the next month\'s party! </p>\r\n<p>See the <a href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=249&amp;Itemid=106\">article in the News section</a>  for more info!</p>','','1','9','0','33','2006-07-17 21:47:26','72','','2006-07-30 14:00:27','66','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2006-07-17 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','','pageclass_sfx=\r\nback_button=\r\nitem_title=1\r\nlink_titles=\r\nintrotext=1\r\nsection=0\r\nsection_link=0\r\ncategory=0\r\ncategory_link=0\r\nrating=\r\nauthor=\r\ncreatedate=\r\nmodifydate=\r\npdf=\r\nprint=\r\nemail=\r\nkeyref=\r\ndocbook_type=','10','0','8','','','0','2088','hidden-14th-july-2006');

I have also travelled to New York to do a tour consisting of two gigs in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn.

It seems our call to invite a friend in the last email was heard as almost everyone I’ve spoken to either in person or via email has heard about Planet Angel through a friend. We’re receiving the highest mailing list signup rate ever! The comments suggest these are truly like-minded people who really get what we’re about which is really great. We love working with the venue, they’re positive, supportive and are always offering useful input to help us achieve our goals… complete opposite of the venue we worked with before!</p>\r\n<p>Pete &amp; I are now looking to create a new &amp; more responsible Production Manager role as part of Planet Angel’s move towards less reliance on us and more general sharing of responsibilities.&nbsp; This new role will assume full responsibility for the rig and derig and we’re looking for two people to share the role so that they can have regular parties off, more on that once we’ve spec’d the role out.</p>\r\n<p>Also Keni has been over for a meeting to show us an idea he has for putting the door lists on mobile wireless PDA devices, which may then allow for the shop stock take and other useful stuff to be added which is an exciting project we hope to see develop… thanks Keni!&nbsp; If it pans out as planned, Planet Angel will be at the forefront of a new technical development that could be of great value to event organisers all over, cool!</p>\r\n<h3><br />*Chilled*</h3>\r\n<p>We’ve been calling around all the venue leads we’ve been sent, and last week checked out a University, which has strong potential as a *Chilled* venue… it has several different areas, room for a proper stage for live acts, lots of furniture an outside area etc… it would be an expansion of the previous chilled formula and there’s a lot of stuff to work out to see if it’s viable but it‘s the most suitable venue we’ve seen so far so fingers crossed!</p>\r\n<h3>Productions</h3>\r\n<p>We’ve submitted an event proposal for the HCI Conference which has been signed off, they’re really happy with our ideas so now we get on with the fun bit of making it happen!

Whether you’re a Planet Angel party regular or otherwise, I’d say its because you are browsing this web site simply on the back of information or personal experience you have been exposed to through like minded people &amp; that makes PA unique.</P>','<P>Though my personal passion for music, of many genres, stretches way back to my formative years. My inception as someone privileged enough to transmit it as a form of entertainment began only in 2001. </P>\r\n<P><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/CrewContribs/alaugee.jpg\" width=\"168\" height=\"61\" style=\"float: right;\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" border=\"0\" />At the time, my PC had accumulated a vast swathe of tunes that, unbeknownst to me, were waiting to escape the confines of what was really just a domestic jukebox. I transferred them to C.d. so I could listen to it all on a decent conventional stereo &amp;, as a logical progression, purchased a couple of cdj players. It was only then when I made the transition from using the music to entertain myself to crafting the material for the enjoyment of others. </P>\r\n<P>At the party, you can regularly hear me play in the Funky Lounge &amp; can expect to listen to “invigorating” music containing a ska / reggae, rock &amp; retro spirit, plus influences inspired by indigenous vocals /instruments from all corners of the earth, just add western house &amp; breaks rhythms &amp; voila! Think summer, open air carnivals &amp; fiestas contained within the night club environment &amp; you’re your at least half way there!&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P>I was born &amp; brought up in Torbay, Devon. I reckon my first real electronic sound / visual awakening came about when I was 13. Watching TV with my dad, we were both really taken back by the most incredible concert laid on by Jean Michel Jarre, live in Houston. I mean lets face it, there aren’t too many buildings on the English Riviera more than a few stories high &amp; yet here was this bloke using Texan sky scrapers as a back drop for gigantic visual projections. Quite a profound impression for an impressionable country lad!</P>\r\n<P>I moved to London at 17 to undertake 3 years full time study at a performing arts college with 70% of the course component in dance. Maybe the writing had started to make an indelible impression on the wall from then?&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P>What are my wishes for the future? More of the same please. In the western world, at least, there sadly appears to be an increasing appetite to search for personal thrills through pursuing the thoughts &amp; actions of others. It is therefore refreshing to know that, within a group of people such as this, there’s an impassioned enthusiasm to search for “actual” contentment without any noticeable hankering for self-inflation. Through my own contribution I personally endeavour to aid this ethos because when it all comes together good, there are not many events where the sum of all parts gel quite like it does at Planet Angel. </P>\r\n<P>Please feel at liberty to find me at the party for discussion, say hello or simply chat about the weather.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Love &amp; Cheers </P>\r\n<P>ade laugée</P>\r\n<P>Contact: <A href=\"mailto:alaugee@hotmail.com\">alaugee@hotmail.com</A>&nbsp; Mobile: 07790 001745 <BR></P>','1','12','0','47','2006-08-30 16:24:32','64','','2006-08-30 16:39:00','64','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2006-08-30 16:21:45','0000-00-00 00:00:00','CrewContribs/alaugee.jpg|right||0||bottom||','','pageclass_sfx=\r\nback_button=\r\nitem_title=1\r\nlink_titles=\r\nintrotext=1\r\nsection=0\r\nsection_link=0\r\ncategory=0\r\ncategory_link=0\r\nrating=\r\nauthor=\r\ncreatedate=\r\nmodifydate=\r\npdf=\r\nprint=\r\nemail=\r\nkeyref=\r\ndocbook_type=','3','0','5','','','0','1709','ade-lauge');

The build up of the night started about two weeks before! I started to get \"party belly\", as we call it. It\'s the softest of butterflies in your belly, a mixture of anticipation and excitement. You want the night to be everything you remember Planet Angel to be, but you always think - was it really that good or was I just imagining it? It\'s hard to comprehend how special Planet Angel actually is and how all the Party people are so on the same wavelength as you and everyone else. It\'s in a league of its own.</P>\r\n<DIV style=\"FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 8px 0pt 8px 8px\">{jgxtimg src:=[images/stories/gallery2/20061013/Glenn/20061310%20(48).JPG] width:=[200]}</DIV>\r\n<P>Anyway, back to the Party. As we arrived, we all stopped and stared at the queue. We had never seen it as long as it was! But we were about an hour late and forgot to order our tickets online, which I totally recommend to all. However we waited our turn agreeing that next time we would either get here earlier or get online tickets - then before we knew it we were walking past the garden and our night had truly begun!<BR><BR>We saw many new faces and many familiar ones, which was awesome. The first part of my night was spent showing my friend around as it was her first time. She was absolutely astounded with the venue, people, music, decor, everything!&nbsp; She didn\'t believe that this could actually exist. We ventured into the garden and we amazed at the hot food that was available! I\'ve been coming for three years and this was the first time I knew about this! This is so true of Planet Angel; there is always something else you find, learn, experience or feel. No matter how many times you go.</P>\r\n<P>For the rest of the night I did my duty as a Glitterbug, ensuring every one was sparkling in the lights and relaxed. At 3am I found myself at the Fruit. So with a flash of glitter I was off. I remember offering fruit out, then somehow I ended up feeding people grapes, which everyone loved. Being a Fruit person is very fulfilling; the strange looks you get to start with turn into absolute amazement and happiness!</P>\r\n<DIV style=\"FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 8px 8pt 8px 0px\">{jgxtimg src:=[images/stories/gallery2/20061013/Glenn/20061310%20(27).JPG] width:=[200]}</DIV>\r\n<P>I would like to say a huge thank you to the DJ at the end of the night, as we all thought it was over and you brought us all back with another kicking tune.

Neuro-linguistic programming is the study of the structure of subjective experience, the study of how people think. As a quick example if you think of something that you are motivated to do, a large proportion of you will see a picture in your head. For most of us if you move that picture further away it will become less motivating, closer and it becomes more motivating. NLP explores how we represent our thinking to ourselves in words, pictures and feelings and offers ways to alter said thinking for change.Hypnotism has been around for centuries and comes with a fair amount of cultural baggage, in fact when it became public at work that I was training in hypnosis a couple of people wouldn’t look me in the eye…<BR></P>\r\n<P>In actuality, hypnotic states are part and parcel of ordinary consciousness, examples include that lovely state in-between sleeping and waking. A hypnotist just has skills in inducing hypnotic states in others and using these states to help facilitate changes in their lives.I have been seeing clients in a private practise for a year and enjoy it immenselyI love history and work part-time at the Museum of London.I am a musician and currently am writing some new material for public performance. </P>\r\n<P>Name: Andi Hall<BR>Description: Neuro-linguistic programmer and Hypnotist<BR>Email: adh@blueyonder.co.uk<BR>Website: In progress<BR>Phone: 07786513829</P>','1','12','0','46','2006-10-27 10:01:43','64','','2006-10-27 10:10:49','64','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2006-10-27 09:58:50','0000-00-00 00:00:00','CrewContribs/andi_hall.jpg|right||0||bottom||','','pageclass_sfx=\nback_button=\nitem_title=1\nlink_titles=\nintrotext=1\nsection=0\nsection_link=0\ncategory=0\ncategory_link=0\nrating=\nauthor=\ncreatedate=\nmodifydate=\npdf=\nprint=\nemail=\nkeyref=\ndocbook_type=','4','0','6','','','0','950','andi-hall');

We had just an hour and a half to rig the boat! </P>\r\n<DIV style=\"FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 8px 8pt 8px 8px\">{jgxtimg src:=[images/stories/gallery2/20061231/glenn_photos/DSC00883.JPG] width:=[180]}</DIV>\r\n<P align=justify>Rigging means loading and setting up everything; food and catering systems for nearly 200 people, (do you know how heavy salads that size are!), the PA system, the decor, the flower arrangements, the lights etc etc.&nbsp; OK, if this was a case of opening the back doors and wheeling it all in, then hey no problem.&nbsp; Nope, for this event it meant parking the van on the pavement and carrying everything up over the flood barrier, across a sodden wet walkway, down another - perilously steep - walkway to the main pier, up onto a swaying barge (with a gap between just big enough to fall into and disappear into the cold grey Thames) along the slippery metal barge, down some steep, slippery, wet metal steps, hop across another 30cm gap, then another onto another boat, across that boat hop another gap and onto our boat that was ‘triple parked’ as far away from the pier as is imaginable.&nbsp; Occasionally the boats would drift apart and the gap would be too far to jump so you’d have to stand there in the half light getting wet in the drizzle, waiting until the gap closed a bit. And all this with something heavy or awkward in your arms. Once on board we had to scramble back for another load, 12 of us made about 3 terrifying trips each! </P>\r\n<DIV style=\"FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 8px 8pt 8px 8px\">{jgxtimg src:=[images/stories/gallery2/20061231/glenn_photos/DSC00912.JPG] width:=[180]}</DIV>\r\n<P align=justify mce_keep=\"true\">After the usual gambit of “who’d-have-thought-that-could-go-wrong” rigging problems (like – we found the only surface on the planet that high grade water-proof gaffa tape doesn’t stick to) we managed to get everything ready just in time for boarding - which ended up being delayed by two other boats that had badly managed boarding procedures… It turned out that Jenni and Arif (who were responsible for the Planet Angel boarding process) ended up helping customers of the other boats to get organised – the Yellow Planet Angel Host jackets acted like beacons to panicky random people wondering which boat they should be boarding!</P>\r\n<P align=justify mce_keep=\"true\">Eventually our boat – bathed in purple light and clearly identifiable as the “Planet Angel Boat” - arrived at the Pier amid cheers and sighs of relief, especially from the three guys who had run all the way from Embankment with literally seconds to spare..&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P align=justify mce_keep=\"true\">The journey started gently amid the gentle tunes served up by Resident DJ Nibbler and people started to settle in.. The Planet Angel Kitchen was swamped with people from the start and the food that we’d planned for months was almost completely devoured in about 90 minutes! By the time Resident DJ Dr. F took over at around 10:30 the atmosphere had built up to full pre-party state and the vibe was great!</P>\r\n<DIV style=\"FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 8px 8pt 8px 8px\">{jgxtimg src:=[images/stories/gallery2/20061231/glenn_photos/DSC01079.JPG] width:=[180]}</DIV>\r\n<P align=justify mce_keep=\"true\">As no boats are allowed near the London firework display we’d initially planned to cruise downriver towards Greenwich and then back up, but after a word with the helpful Captain Bill, we re-planned the route to be as near as we were allowed to be to the London Eye just before midnight… We arrived in time to grab a great mooring spot and, as BBC Radio 4 announced midnight, the fireworks started to a soundtrack by DJ Dr. F that can only be described as exquisite – as anyone there will surely testify. It was a magical moment, the huge skylights of the boat were open with loads of people standing on chairs, their heads out of the boat watching the London Eye light up with fireworks and waving to other people on boats next to us doing the same.. and the sound of beautiful music and fireworks mixing in the cool evening air..</P>\r\n<P align=justify mce_keep=\"true\">For the rest of the cruise we set off upriver and back down again in full party mode waving at the thousands of people lining the bridges as we slid gently under them. Special guest <A href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=268&amp;Itemid=127\">DJ Ade Laugee</A> played a fantastic set of classic uplifting trance that seemed like a collection of the best tunes played at Planet Angel throughout the years... and a party ensued.</P>\r\n<P align=justify mce_keep=\"true\">As we arrived back at Festival Pier and disembarked, the party spirit and smiles were carried off on Sea legs to countless house parties, after parties and other New Year’s Eve events…&nbsp; What a night.</P>\r\n<P align=justify mce_keep=\"true\">And then we had 20 minutes to derig!</P>\r\n<P align=justify mce_keep=\"true\">&nbsp;</P>\r\n<P align=center mce_keep=\"true\">***</P>\r\n<P align=justify mce_keep=\"true\">New Years Eve....Thanks to everyone who contributed to make it my best ever!

I’m pleased to report the reverse is true!&nbsp; I’m not as on-top of the workload as I used to be, and we’re both working weekends to stay on top of it, but apart from being quite tired it feels good… like this new injection of energy could make a huge positive difference to what happens next.&nbsp; It’s also really interesting to play a part in how other peoples businesses operate, it’s a great yardstick, great learning experience and enforces the benefits of what we do and why we do it.</P>\r\n<P>I won’t lie to you, it’s really hard work at the moment, in fact it reminds me of the first couple of years when all we did was work and sleep, but somehow this time around it feels different… we feel more prepared for it, we feel more experienced, and we feel like we’ve got more support – real support, the kind of support that’s prepared pull up it’s sleeves, get it’s hands dirty and take the rough with the smooth.&nbsp; That feels great!</P>\r\n<P>With Planet Angel we feel we’re really on track: expanding from just running the Party every month to putting on extra quality events in other areas such as ROCKS!, the corporate event we managed in September, and of course New Year’s Eve!…&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the things we’re doing work really well and some of them need tweaking, but this is all part of stepping outside the comfort zone right? We’re also learning a lot about catering so that we have our own means to lay on proper food at the events we hold, the first was at ROCKS! and the second will be at New Year’s Eve… the value of being able to do this ourselves cannot be underestimated and it’s something we’ve wanted to do for a long time.<BR>I’m pleased we’re trying and I’m pleased we’re progressing, we need to ‘push the boat’ a bit if we are going to take Planet Angel to the next level and make sure it’s around for all of us in years to come. <BR><BR>We think the Party is really rocking and with the help of everyone’s feedback we’re managing to keep making enough regular little improvements to the way things work each month to not have a whole load of problems bunch up that need solutions… A much better strategy!</P>\r\n<P>By the way, with all the new projects kicking off we thought we’d explain how people get to head up new projects… (like Ali &amp; G – website, Sam – shop, Becky - NYE &amp; Don - Planet Angel Kitchen…).&nbsp; Basically people have always put themselves forward… they’ve let us know they are, a) motivated to do it, b) have the skills to do it, and c) have the time to do it.&nbsp; Thought it might be worth pointing that out – if you’re interested in taking something forward and you’ve considered the above, feel free to get in contact.

Traditionally a ‘rock’ event, we were the only electronic band playing and were approached afterwards by a man named John: “You guys were great, you should play at Planet Angel. They’d love you!” he said.</P>','<P><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/CrewContribs/serotoninpromoshot_180.gif\" width=\"180\" height=\"161\" style=\"float: right;\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" border=\"0\" />So we got onto the internet and found when the next party was. Planet Angel was inspirational. A place full of friendly people with no attitude. There was more happiness in one building than anywhere we’d been before!</P>\r\n<P>Soon after, we wrote the tracks “Angel” and “Sirius” and kept coming back month after month for our Planet Angel fix! Over the years we have met SO many great people and the biggest highlight was in February 2007 when we performed in the Meltdown Room. We played a banging set of Uplifting and Hard Trance, interspersed with Azadeh’s sultry Eastern vocals. It really was playing in front of friends.</P>\r\n<P mce_keep=\"true\">&nbsp;</P>\r\n<P mce_keep=\"true\">&nbsp;</P>\r\n<P><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/CrewContribs/serotoninpromoshot2_180.gif\" width=\"180\" height=\"167\" style=\"float: left;\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" border=\"0\" />You can keep track of what’s happening in the world of Serotonin by checking out <A href=\"http://www.myspace.com/serotoninmusicuk\" mce_href=\"http://www.myspace.com/serotoninmusicuk\">www.myspace.com/serotoninmusicuk</A> or <A href=\"http://www.serotoninmusic.co.uk/\" mce_href=\"http://www.serotoninmusic.co.uk/\">www.serotoninmusic.co.uk</A>.

They were co-hosting the Meta Gallery, which consistently had some of the best tunes, and a friendly, interactive environment. We met again at Ravelation when my partner Shelley and I were hosting the Chill space and the fledgling Planet Angel was starting to spread its wings in a bit of courtyard/alley adjacent to the building we were in...</P>','<P>Again, they had great tunes and people being encouraged to paint, model plasticine or just dance and have fun. I liked these people!<BR><BR>When U-4-IC invited us to the <A href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=63&amp;Itemid=56\">first party at the Arches</A> we immediately said yes and brought along many friends, collectively known as the \'lovesquad\' and had an absolute blast. It was now that I realised that this was a viable and sustainable party capable of breaking the London Underground/Club mould. It was a group of friendly people providing the environment for likeminded people to come and really let their hair down and all done by word of mouth. It created a very special atmosphere... and continues to do so to this day.<BR>The party moved to the Imperial Gardens in Camberwell and I was officially part of the team. Rigging, de-rigging / scaffolding and carpentry as well as caretaking in its earliest form were the roles I performed and enjoyed. A year flew past to a soundtrack of music that made me feel as if I had \'winged heels\', music that left me feeling elated not exhausted. The resident DJ\'s U-4-IC, Therapy and Tequila did a fantastic job.<BR><BR>It was then, at various house- and after-parties that I got the opportunity to play some of my music: down-tempo grooves with a Latin or Asian twist and, because I’m the oldest by some distance, some tracks from the 60’s and 70’s that stand up even today. And so it began… Richard Morley (U-4-IC) lent me a set of CD decks, Matt Smith (DJ Therapy) lent me a great little mixer and, with guidance from them and Steve Taylor (DJ Silverback), I was soon doing a regular slot in the chill bar at the “Gardens”.<BR><BR>When Pete and Angel launched <A href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=7&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid=28\">\'Planet Angel *Chilled*</A>\' I was honoured to be asked to look after the music side of things, booking the other DJ’s and live acts. This also gave me a regular afternoon/ early evening slot to hone my chillout and down-tempo grooves as well as venturing into more bouncy rhythms as I gradually lifted the pace ready for the more seasoned dance DJ’s to take over for the final set. It was an event that I loved dearly, helping to create a unique vibe where children and adults both felt equally at home. I’m sure that it will be on our agenda of events as soon as the right venue becomes available again. <BR><BR>I’m currently the resident Chill Bar DJ at Planet Angel’s current venue, and I’m in the process of expanding my repertoire to include funky house, tech house and breaks. My opening sets in the Funky Lounge have been great fun and having a full dance floor ‘rock out’ to the tunes you’re playing is quite a buzz. <BR><BR>I have always had a passion for music in many of its varied forms and to be given the opportunity to DJ at what I consider to be one of the best and friendliest clubs in London is truly an unexpected honour. So, to conclude and before I get too misty eyed, I’d like to say a big thank you to Pete and Angel for the chance, a big thank you to the DJ’s who were so generous with their time, expertise and friendship, a big thank you to all of the crew who work tirelessly behind the scenes and on the night, And a big thank you to all the guests who continue to support Planet Angel and make it what it is: The Best Party In London.</P>\r\n<P>Contact:&nbsp;<A href=\"mailto:nibbler@onelove.co.uk\" mce_href=\"mailto:nibbler@onelove.co.uk\">nibbler@onelove.co.uk</A></P>','1','12','0','47','2007-02-23 22:48:36','64','','2007-02-24 00:02:42','64','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2007-02-23 22:47:22','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','','pageclass_sfx=\nback_button=\nitem_title=1\nlink_titles=\nintrotext=1\nsection=0\nsection_link=0\ncategory=0\ncategory_link=0\nrating=\nauthor=\ncreatedate=\nmodifydate=\npdf=\nprint=\nemail=\nkeyref=\ndocbook_type=','8','0','4','','','0','1081','andy-cunningham-dj-nibbler');

Last year we put up a questionnaire on the website to gain feedback on a number of issues and to see what everyone had to say about the future of Planet Angel. It covered every aspect of Planet Angel including The Party and *Chilled*, but also the overall direction we\'re heading in and other exciting projects on the horizon.</P>','<P>It was a real opportunity for everyone to have their say in the future of Planet Angel and we thank everyone who took part.</P>\r\n<P>We were blown away by how many of you took the time to work through all the questions and seized the opportunity to really tell us what you think through the comments sections… (See below) there were pages and pages of comments, they were upfront, honest and to the point and helped raise awareness of stuff we can now improve, some induced spine-tingling moments of pride, and some contained simply fantastic ideas!</P>\r\n<P>Here are the key findings from the questionnaire results that we\'ll be using to keep on improving things: </P>\r\n<P><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/NewsArticles/quote1.jpg\" width=\"110\" height=\"270\" style=\"float: left;\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"Quote One\" title=\"Quote One\" border=\"0\" />Planet Angel is more than a \'rave\' or club, or a party… we\'re all part of a strong social network which is continually developing and evolving by word of mouth… so you may or may not be surprised to hear that <EM>everyone</EM> stated “the friendly people” as a reason for going to Planet Angel! “The friendly people” was also the <EM>most important</EM> reason for going, music and dancing came second along with other social stuff like meeting friends…</P>\r\n<P>In addition, 95% of those who took part said they’d benefitted from Planet Angel. This is a fantastic result because as you know <A href=\"list/about/#about_wiaa\" target=_blank mce_href=\"list/about/#about_wiaa\">one of the aims</A> is that Planet Angel is of real benefit to people: a ‘Social Profit’ as it’s called.&nbsp; The most common benefits were increased self-confidence and a larger group of friends - both of which are fundamental to increasing self-esteem, which of course everyone needs :0) Other reasons have tangible benefits with many examples of people having found the confidence to change their careers, with most moving into the voluntary/charity sectors and some saying they gained the confidence to start their own businesses. Since Planet Angel\'s officially stated aims are to make a social and environmental profit (not a financial one) this basically means it\'s doing very, very well!</P>\r\n<P>That\'s all good, however… One of the most intriguing results was about \'securing a building as a permanent home’ which as you know has always been one of Planet Angel\'s <A href=\"list/about/#about_wiaa\" target=_blank mce_href=\"list/about/#about_wiaa\">stated aims</A> since the beginning back in 1999. As it turns out, only about 50% of people (who filled in the Questionnaire) were particularly interested in the building: which was a real surprise.</P>\r\n<P>Conversely, what was loud &amp; clear, was that almost all of us (97%) are interested in an outdoor event, and around 90% want to see environmental responsibility at that event.</P>\r\n<P>We can see from the efforts of others that have done so, that securing and running a building is a massive undertaking and one that undoubtedly needs a lot of focus, commitment, resources and energy to plan it and make it work. Whilst we\'re certainly not suggesting it\'s ditched, we reckon that a building should take a back seat while we focus on what most people want: to get Planet Angel outdoors so we can all have fun in the sun and start to make an environmental profit as well as a social profit!</P>\r\n<P><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/NewsArticles/quote3.jpg\" width=\"110\" height=\"231\" style=\"float: right;\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"Quote Three\" title=\"Quote Three\" border=\"0\" />With this in mind, we\'ve started pitching to festivals for 2008 and have a few plans in the pipeline... As with the children\'s story \'The Tortoise and The Hare\' we won\'t try and run too fast, but we\'re aiming to make steady progress, not stopping until we reach the finish line :0)</P>\r\n<P>Over the coming months we’ll also be looking at other ways Planet Angel can create an Environmental Profit: as always feel free to <A href=\"community/getting-involved/\" target=_blank mce_href=\"community/getting-involved/\">get involved</A> or make some suggestions.</P>\r\n<P>As you can see your input has been absolutely invaluable in shaping the future of Planet Angel and we thank you all for playing a part in the next phase of the dream… </P>\r\n<P>Don’t worry if you didn’t get to fill in the questionnaire, we know that Planet Angel is about people and we’re going to introduce more regular questionnaires and other ways for everyone to communicate and help influence the future of Planet Angel.

Planet became my favourite club and gave me a perfect handle on how I want social life to run. It\'s been a comfort in times of stress and family disruption, and it\'s always made me smile when I walk in. It\'s a place I can go to in my head at the drop of a hat, and it never lets me donw.<BR>~ x ~<BR>My organisational skills and confidence have improved without any shadow of a doubt. My understanding of how an organisation like Planet Angel can work in this competitive, commercial world has helped me in both my personal and working life.<BR>~ x ~<BR>It\'s given me contact with a large group of people who are all disinterested in the general world of clubbing and long for the unity felt when surrounded by so many like-minded people. For me, Planet Angel is a place I can go and dance, sing, be happy and silly, be completely outrageous [which is being myself!] and not have people come up to me a beat me up for wearing neon-orange, or for having bad hair, or for dancing like i might mean it.&nbsp; Planet Angel opened up my eyes and allowed me to see that there is hope for the human race. We\'re not all b*stards out to screw one another over, sometimes nice people are just nice people :D<BR>~ x ~<BR>you guys probably have had one of the biggest influences on my life.<BR>~ x ~<BR>In so many ways, it\'s lead me to a happier and healthier place in my personal life, and opened my eyes up to positive influences which have helped me to overcome personal demons and lead to a better job (in a charity) and to a sense of self worth and perspective in a world that can sometimes be very challenging.<BR>~ x ~<BR>life changing! My attitude towards life and being able to talk about things that were all supressed!<BR>~ x ~<BR>I\'ve built up a wonderful network of friends who have given me excellent moral support through some hard times.&nbsp; Without the Planet Angel network I\'d probably have hit the valium by now.&nbsp; It\'s also given me a great opportunity to explore my own creativity and has boosted my self confidence.&nbsp; It\'s given me a much more relaxed outlook on life and definitely keeps my stress levels down.<BR>~ x ~<BR>ive been able to act as i want not how society sees fit, its helped build my confidence and my self esteem, and i get to meet the best peeps around....<BR>~ x ~<BR>it\'s made me look differently at life. I now treat everyone the way i\'m treated at the party. Everyone is non judgemental and accepting, and i try to put this into my life.<BR>~ x ~<BR>It\'s nice to know there are like minded people<BR>~ x ~<BR>its made me a very very very confidant person....<BR>~ x ~<BR>It\'s inspiring to know that there are people who care and are passionate about what they do.&nbsp; Planet Angel has added a dimension to my life that I thought I had lost forever and that only came around once in a while before. The chance to relax and be myself and really have a good time.&nbsp; <BR>~ x ~<BR>It\'s been a social framework for making me the person I wanted to be.<BR>~ x ~<BR>It\'s changed my life. My social life. My friends. My outlook. There\'s no going back for me.<BR>~ x ~<BR>It\'s given me the opportunity to meet some genuinely remarkable people who I would no doubt not have had the honour of getting to know otherwise.<BR>~ x ~<BR>It has broadened my mind, brought me in contact with some truly amazing people, made me find myself and like myself more by giving me a safe haven once a month to just be. It has been a poignant turning point in my life!<BR>~ x ~<BR>It has given me great opportunities to progress my art, I have met many great people through it and built networks with them that have brought me business.<BR>~ x ~<BR>It helped me regain myself and my life, I found planet angel at a bad time in my life and it was the best escape for me to dance my troubles away meet loads for really great people and feel safe to go on my own and not worry about being a billy no mates as you all made me so welcome.&nbsp; It has allowed me to dress up and laugh and live and built my confidence again and help me find myself.&nbsp; It makes me smile every time I think about it.<BR>~ x ~<BR>I\'m a lot more relaxed about life and enjoy meeting such a wide cross section of like-minded people.<BR>~ x ~<BR>I\'m more confident, have met a great group of people, have developed skills working at PA that have helped me in the rest of my life.<BR>~ x ~<BR>Sorry! It\'s only a bit of fun<BR>~ x ~<BR>I walked off the dance floor after 3 hours of solid dancing with make up streaming everywhere and it was treated like the most normal thing in the world. No bitchy looks, no snide comments, just understanding smiles from those doing the same as me, totally losing it :)<BR>~ x ~<BR>Oh, come on, you know.<BR>~ x ~<BR>Another way i\'ve benefited from this amazing place is that its made me realise that even though loads of sh*t people in the world do really bad things, theres still so many wonderful warm-hearted people out there waiting for you to speak to them.<BR>~ x ~<BR>I have met some amazing people and the parties have opened up my mind to all the different and cool people that you can meet if you find the right place! People always told me Planet Angel changed them in a good way, and only when I first went did I understand why. I love it!<BR>~ x ~<BR>I have met many new friends and had some really beautiful experiences, experiences that I will no doubt remember for many years to come.<BR>~ x ~<BR>I have met new friends and have been made closer to alot of my friends around me.

Some of them are like family to me now, and many of them I only see when I am AT Planet. Just stop and think about that.. My life, my social group, the very things that I define as most important to me.. they would be different if I had not discovered The Party. I cannot say more than that.<BR>~ x ~<BR>I have learnt that there is more to life than the average clubs i used to go to...i tell people about your club all the time and all the people i have gone with wake up and feel like it was a dream!<BR>~ x ~<BR>i have made some good friends and had some brilliant experiences. i am not mad on dancing but it is cool just mucking about with new and old friends. i can definitely say i have never had a bad night and on several occasions i have turned up even when the rest of my friends couldnt make it. also i don\'t feel too old to party there as the age range is vast. i know at least 2 sets of people who are planning to be married soon.<BR>~ x ~<BR>I have become a more chilled person and have been able to talk to people a lot easier than before.<BR>~ x ~<BR>I believe everything happens for a reason, cause and effect. I can\'t imagine how my life would be without all the wonderful people I have met through Planet Angel in one way or another.<BR>~ x ~<BR>Helped me gain confidence, deal with my sexuality, come out (in the party itself actually...), met loads of friends, got a job from someone I met there, found a whole new range of music and realised that it isnt me that\'s strange...well it is but so is&nbsp; everyone else and that\'s fine :)<BR>~ x ~<BR>Helped me recognise the fact that everyone can be who they are and it is a good thing to just be.<BR>~ x ~<BR>how big is this box ;-) mainly it\'s had all kinds of lovely spin offs into my life when I\'m not at PA or chilled.

As always the fine attention to décor and other elements to heighten your senses amazed me. Once you have stepped inside, you enter a world that has been created especially for you. There’s the soothing scent of incense, fairy lights, the chance to play like a carefree child, eye-catching artwork everywhere, and of course thumping beats on two dance floors.&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P align=justify>After wandering around to observe my unique surroundings, I settled in the Meltdown Room for an emotional journey of uplifting trance that pulsed through the crowd. Resident DJs Sly One and Jurrane set the tone with an energetic back-to-back performance, followed by Greg Blaquiere who continued with a wave of tracks that rippled through the bouncing crowd. Guest DJ Pablo from Knowwhere turned up the heat with an impressive mix of new and classic trance tunes.</P>\r\n<P align=justify>Nibbler, DuffJ, Dr F, Ade Laugee and Side Trakka kept the crowd entertained with funky and deep sexy sounds in the Funky Lounge. </P>\r\n<P align=justify>In the Chill Bar Dr F, Ade Laugee, Paygan, Nibbler and Sly One soothed everyone with the best chilled tracks and relaxing atmosphere. </P>\r\n<P align=justify>Several hours later I joined my friends in the outside garden area for a breath of fresh air and a cup of tea. I recognised familiar faces, glanced at the many new faces and soon started varied conversations with like-minded individuals.

The land is used with permission from one of their dads who owns it!</P>\r\n<P>There is a fun line-up of bands and a few different areas like a main stage with bands and DJs and an alternative tent with acoustic music and fun stuff to do. It sounds like they’re putting a lot of effort into it.</P>\r\n<P>The whole event is a charity fund raiser and normal ticket price is £40. However, as we were only going camping we’ve agreed a special camping rate of £12 for the weekend which is what it would have cost at the camp site we usually use. They have said tho, that they’d really prefer people to arrive on Friday night – they don’t want the road to the field being used on Saturday night and drawing attention.</P>\r\n<P>The other thing we’ve agreed is that we’ll run a funky Planet Angel Bar!&nbsp; It’s our weekend off so there’s no pressure but we reckon it’ll be great fun and good experience!&nbsp; We’re thinking a bigger affair than last year... They’ll supply a cool marquee and electricity and we’re thinking lets do it up big time. Mick and&nbsp;Pete are up for building a proper U shaped bar area out of pallets like last year so we can serve drinks to people sitting at the bar.&nbsp; The aim is to sell reasonably priced drinks to provide the facility for the event and get good experience rather than aim to make profit.&nbsp; We can take a system and some decks and come up with a cool DJ line-up and we’re even thinking we could do a big BBQ or something for the Saturday night.&nbsp; The bar area would also make a communal eating area – that worked really well last year.&nbsp; Also we’ve agreed to build and manage a fire at the Bar.</P>\r\n<P>They are very keen for us to go and join them and we reckon it’ll be a great laugh and some more cool experience of doing something outside and running a bar...</P>\r\n<P>As ever the idea is that we all chip in a bit and have a laugh so please let us know what you’re up for doing! Lauren’s sorting out the invites and Angel’s working out the drinks prices and logistics and music schedule so we’ve got that covered... Oh and kids are welcome!</P>\r\n<P>And remember you can invite two friends as well! Please note places are limited and are offered on a first come first served basis, so, to ensure your place, please make sure you confirm by email only...to <A href=\"mailto:lauren@planetangel.net\">lauren@planetangel.net</A>. We need your full name and a mobile number and the full name of your partner and friends.&nbsp; We can’t confirm your place without that info!</P>\r\n<P>We’ll be issuing wristbands on the Friday so please have your money ready then... As mentioned this is a charity fund-raising event for Cancer Research UK so if you’d like to donate a bit more feel free. </P>\r\n<P>We’ll update this page regularly as things develop ...</P>\r\n<P mce_keep=\"true\">&nbsp;</P>\r\n<H3 align=center>And... ....

The neighbours know that people will be arriving on Friday evening but the idea is that people don’t arrive on Saturday evening as well.&nbsp; So, if you <U>really</U> can’t arrive on Friday evening, please arrive on Saturday during the morning/midday and please try to car pool to keep traffic to a minimum. The same goes for people leaving please don’t plan to leave on Saturday night!</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Re Dogs</STRONG>: no problem if they’re well behaved and constantly being looked after by the owners and that their crap is picked up!</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Re the festival:</STRONG> we do have full access to the festival, our tickets are not just for camping they are full festi tickets!</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Re DJing at the Bar:</STRONG> OK we’re looking for a flow of music that’s chilled and cool in the mornings fun during the afternoon and getting funky at night... We don’t want to compete with the main stage so we’re not thinking of bringing a big system, just enough to have a boogie to around the bar if you want type thing! </P>\r\n<P>We’ve now sorted the decks mixer and PA system&nbsp;and Elaine has offered to coordinate the DJs so if you’d like to play please email her at <A href=\"mailto:elainemayes@gmail.com\" mce_href=\"mailto:elainemayes@gmail.com\">elainemayes@gmail.com</A> and include a brief description of the kind of set(s) that you’d like to play.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Re Car Pooling:</STRONG> The Car Pooling Officer failed to show up for work so unfortunately we’re unable to help in this respect, hopefully everyone’s arranged a way of getting there!</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Re paying for your ticket:</STRONG> We can do that when you arrive and get your wrist band (at the Bar).</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Re helping:</STRONG> OK We\'ve sorted a few areas that need but we still need help with the following:</P>\r\n<P>Setting up the Bar, (the day before)<BR>Decor-ing it, (mad ideas welcome! Please bring whatever Decor you have)<BR>Lighting Kit (please bring lights if you have any)<BR>Crewing the bar <BR>We’ll keep amending this page so please check it regularly, if we all chip in a little bit no-one will have to do a lot!</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Re getting there:</STRONG> Here are the directions!<BR>Luckley Road, Wokingham, Berks, RG40 3AU</P>\r\n<P><STRONG><EM>By car:</EM></STRONG> <STRONG>NB</STRONG> If you are travelling by Sat-Nav, DO NOT USE THE POSTCODE. Instead, type in LUCKLEY ROAD, WOKINGHAM as the postcode in the Sat-Nav will take you the other side of a dead-end and is a mission to get back-on-track from. </P>\r\n<P>Exit the M4 at junction 10. Follow the A329M towards Wokingham, then turn off onto the A329 into the town centre. Follow the one-way system around the back of the town until you come to a large roundabout junction and take the exit marked A321 SANDHURST. Follow that road until you come to a roundabout with a Tescos on it (last chance for supplies), go straight over, then straight over the mini roundabout.</P>\r\n<P>Luckley Road is the second left, about a quarter of a mile with a signpost saying \"Luckley - Oakfield School\" as well as the road sign.<BR>Follow Luckley road to the end (go under the bridge) and then the track up to the Cottage is at the very end of the road on the right, and will have a marvellous Wonderland Sign.</P>\r\n<P><BR><STRONG><EM>By Train:</EM></STRONG> From London Waterloo to Wokingham. A direct train takes: 1hr 6min. The site is about 10 minutes from the station, we\'re getting a couple of cab numbers and will post them soon (probably...)!</P>\r\n<P mce_keep=\"true\">&nbsp;</P>\r\n<H5 align=center mce_keep=\"true\">&nbsp;Festival Line up!</H5>\r\n<P align=center mce_keep=\"true\"><BR><STRONG>**Friday**</STRONG><BR>&nbsp;<BR>BANDS<BR>&nbsp;<BR>JENNY BALL + THE PETIT FILOUS<BR>The official sound of Wonderland!<BR><A href=\"http://www.myspace.com/jennyballofficial\" mce_href=\"http://www.myspace.com/jennyballofficial\">www.myspace.com/jennyballofficial</A><BR>&nbsp;<BR>BENNY SILVA AND HIS BAND<BR>Funk/rock/hip-hop mashup from your humble host.<BR>(Ben will then be hosting the main stage all weekend)<BR>&nbsp;<BR>DJs<BR>(Drums \'n\' Bass)<BR>&nbsp;<BR>JAMES SLY FOX<BR>Tweedle Dee\'s Junglist Jump-Up mayhem.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>ARKO<BR>Standard upfront jokery.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>BATE<BR>Raw.

Yes, Christmas.&nbsp; Before you turn away in dismay that I’m talking about the festive season so early, spare a moment as this may well change someone’s life. </P>\r\n<P>I’m talking about ethical Christmas presents...</P>','<P>Last year my friends and I decided not to buy each other Christmas presents, but instead all chip in to save acres of rainforest. To save an acre for a year cost £20, much more beneficial to the world than more socks and soaps. <A href=\"http://www.rainforestfoundationuk.org/\" target=_blank mce_href=\"http://www.rainforestfoundationuk.org/\">www.rainforestfoundationuk.org/</A></P>\r\n<P>Of course, just because we live in the Western world and enjoy an affluent lifestyle, doesn’t mean we should be guilt tripped into not giving or receiving presents. If there are things we really want to give or receive then great, why not? But, for those people who you feel you should give a present to, but don’t really know what to get, maybe you could consider an alternative ethical Christmas present? </P>\r\n<P>A good place to start is the Good Giving guide, a free booklet packed with ideas for ethical presents, both for benefit in the UK and abroad. If someone is musical, why not get them a forest full of trees used to make bagpipes and clarinets? Or a beer lover, invest in a brewery for £20. For the plumber in your life, you can buy a pump for an entire African village for £175. You could contribute to a co-op making local soap in Africa for £25. Or how about the gift of sight? £27 to restore sight for one child has got to be worth it. Or if you’re feeling a bit cheeky, how about some prize bull semen to strengthen cattle herds,&nbsp; weakened by conflict. A snip at only £10. Yes, really! Have a look at <A href=\"http://www.goodgifts.org/\" target=_blank mce_href=\"http://www.goodgifts.org/\">www.goodgifts.org/</A> for more details.</P>\r\n<P>If you live in a city and want to be part of beautifying it, and help climate change at the same time, why not check out Trees For Cities. They work with local communities on tree planting projects, making your city a tangibly greener and leafier place. For £20 you can gift a tree and for £175 you can dedicate a tree with a plaque, maybe a beautiful reminder for someone? Their website is <A href=\"http://www.treesforcities.org/\" target=_blank mce_href=\"http://www.treesforcities.org/\">www.treesforcities.org/</A>.</P>\r\n<P>However, for me, my favourite would have to be Send A Cow, it’s a charity I’ve supported for the last 3 years now. This one pulled my heart strings because of the long lasting practical difference it makes. SAC has been going now for nearly 20 years, giving livestock to poverty stricken farmers in Africa, and making a real, sustainable difference. <BR>A lot of other charities have now followed suit in the giving animals theme, Oxfam, Cafod and Kids For Kids to name a few, but for me, SAC is the clear winner with full time staff in the countries affected and strict procedures in place to help the farmers and families in need.</P>\r\n<P>However, it’s not just livestock that can be bought. Orchards, water tanks, donkeys, bee hives and training can all be given as gifts. If you are interested, please see their website for more details and take a little time to read the inspiring case studies. <A href=\"http://www.sendacow.org.uk/\" target=_blank mce_href=\"http://www.sendacow.org.uk/\">www.sendacow.org.uk/</A></P>\r\n<P>If I’ve got you really in the ethical festive mood, there are even more steps you can take! The electrical shop Maplin are now stocking outdoor solar Christmas tree lights <A href=\"http://www.maplin.co.uk/\" target=_blank mce_href=\"http://www.maplin.co.uk/\">www.maplin.co.uk/</A>, and have a look at <A href=\"http://www.soilassociation.org/christmas\" target=_blank mce_href=\"http://www.soilassociation.org/christmas\">www.soilassociation.org/christmas</A> for sustainable Christmas trees.

When I expressed this to friends I was reminded that the Party is web casted. Quickly working out the time differences (-8 GMT) I would find myself being able to view the party my time around 1400 ? So of I went to Vegas, tequila in hand safe in the knowledge that I was going to be able to see some of the party... </EM></P>\r\n<P><EM>Fast forward a week later and a very tired Keni sits in his hotel suite with a steak and wishing he was home, I have NOT time for Vegas and I just really wanted to go home... <BR>1400 came and I switched my laptop on and pointed to planetangel.net and low and behold a link for the webcast. Clicked and up springs windows media player... within moments I’ve looking at a busy meltdown room at many different views and with some funky visuals to accompany it. I watched and listened in amazement, finally some good music in Vegas.

Now I’m a big fan of the Party as you know, but as time rattled on this was Las Vegas on a Friday night I said to myself.&nbsp; It has to be viewed, right... But I’ll miss out on all my mates! Not so, as I grabbed my headphones and my little pda phone and tuned into the same webcast and walked up and down the strip whilst Sly and Jurrane banged out some banging tunes...<BR>I even went into a bar and sat at the end and had some more beers whilst watching the party in full flow.</EM></P>\r\n<P><EM>When the party finished at 0600 I was sitting in my bath robe after a long soak whilst listening/watching the night unfold. That was my cue to go out and see what late night Vegas had to offer.

It is with great regret that we have to announce that our New Year\'s Eve Party is cancelled.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We received a call on Tuesday afternoon (18th Dec.) explaining that Area – the venue we hired especially for NYE - has just come under new ownership, and the new owner will not honour the agreement we have.&nbsp; </p>','<p>This information has been communicated through a third party and despite many attempts to speak directly to the new owner, it appears he will not contact us and will not allow us to have his contact details.&nbsp; As you might expect we\'ve taken professional advice and have been making every effort to resolve the situation but, to no avail. We are examining our legal options but due to the Christmas close down and the litigation process, a remedy would not be available in the timescales we have left and we have no option but to cancel.</p>\r\n<p>We know a lot of people were really looking forward to this event including us, it\'s a very sad situation. We\'ve invested considerably in the preparations and everything is in place for this event, which also means it has very serious implications for Planet Angel as an organisation. </p>\r\n<p>We have taken the decision to cancel the event quickly in order to provide our guests with the opportunity of making alternative arrangements and to ensure that we can notify as many people as possible to avoid disappointment on NYE itself.&nbsp; </p>\r\n<p>We will of course be refunding everyone\'s tickets, however as our ticket T&amp;Cs state there is a £1.50 per ticket booking charge to cover the costs of PayPal\'s fees which unfortunately is non-refundable. We\'ll post up the refund date when we\'ve made the arrangements.&nbsp; In the mean time we are also examining alternative options and the possibilities of working with other colleagues in the industry. It\'s very late in the day but maybe we can work something out.</p>\r\n<p>So, what can we say?&nbsp; It appears that this is one of those situations that life throws up, we are very disappointed.&nbsp; </p>\r\n<p>A lot of people have helped spread the word about this event and we are asking if you could also now help spread the word of the cancellation please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We expect that a lot of people will want to discuss this and talk about possible alternatives so we’ve <a href=\"forum/viewtopic.php?t=511\" target=\"_blank\" mce_href=\"forum/viewtopic.php?t=511\">started a thread</a>  on the Planet Angel forum for this (registration required), available at: <a href=\"forum\" mce_href=\"forum\"><font color=\"#800080\">www.planetangel.net/forum.</font></a>&nbsp;</p><p>Yours Angel and Pete <br /></p>','1','1','0','1','2007-12-21 09:59:49','64','Planet Angel','2007-12-21 17:41:42','70','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2007-12-21 09:55:24','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','','pageclass_sfx=\nback_button=\nitem_title=1\nlink_titles=\nintrotext=1\nsection=0\nsection_link=0\ncategory=0\ncategory_link=0\nrating=\nauthor=\ncreatedate=\nmodifydate=\npdf=\nprint=\nemail=\nkeyref=\ndocbook_type=','4','0','48','','','0','2897','nye-party-important-announcement');

Over a glass of red wine and pizza, she happily unfolded the details and told me how Planet Angel has touched her young life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>1.&nbsp;Give us a brief outline of your life before your first Planet Angel experience.</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>I was a student, going to college and university, and trying many different parties – including old-school raves and live gigs. </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>2.&nbsp;Who introduced you to your first-ever Planet Angel?</STRONG><BR>&nbsp;<BR>I heard about Planet Angel through friends of friends. They kept on saying that it was very different and the best club night they’ve been to.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>3.&nbsp;Describe your first time at Planet Angel.</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>Within the first ten minutes I realised it was very different to any other party or event I’ve been to. I was 18 and it was at the Arches. Everyone was dressed up and really expressed themselves. There were people playing bongos – I’ve never seen that in clubs. I started singing with one guy playing his bongo and soon other people joined in. It was awesome to spend the night with so many like-minded people. I actually met up with the guy afterwards and we did a recording. The whole experience was very empowering. </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>4.&nbsp;How did you become involved with Planet Angel?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>I had to do a project on organising an event for 50 000 people for my course. I decided that my event would be something like a Planet Angel festival and phoned Planet Angel Headquarters for help on a site plan and rationale. They were very welcoming and we got on really well so they asked me if I would like to get involved with the Planet Angel events as they were actually looking for someone at that point. This led to event organising at Planet Angel! </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>5.&nbsp;How would you describe the Planet Angel experience?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>Planet Angel is a different world. It’s a place where you can really be yourself and meet people with similar interests. You learn so much from each other in a relaxing yet social atmosphere. It is so much more than just a job. The October party was the first one I got involved with. It was amazing to be part of the energy and passion. I really understood what Planet Angel was all about and couldn’t stop smiling all night.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>6. How does Planet Angel contribute to other areas of your life?</STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P>I’m much more confident and really grateful to be part of something so happy and uplifting in general. I’m building great event experience and now have something to offer. It’s also a fantastic learning process and the more I learn, the more I have to offer. I meet new friends and people all the time and most important of all – I gain knowledge and strength. </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>7.&nbsp;What is the most amazing thing you’ve learned so far and how does it apply to your life in general?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>A job doesn’t have to be just a job. Planet Angel is not just a company, but a social organisation. They play a very important role in my learning experience. The benefits are endless! Pete and Angel really guide me. They’ve created a place where everyone can have a good time and take everyone’s aspirations into consideration. </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>8. What is your most memorable Planet Angel moment and why?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>I once got separated from my friends. I went to the ladies to look for them and we ended up staying in there for a while, singing to music from my friend’s walkman. It was bizarre!</P>\r\n<P>Another moment was on the funky floor… I couldn’t stop dancing and ended up on the podium. Loads of people joined me and the feeling of unity was overwhelming. </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>9.&nbsp;What do you see happening on the future dance floors of Planet Angel?</STRONG><BR>&nbsp;<BR>I think Planet Angel will evolve with new trends. They really listen to people’s suggestions. The dance scene is changing and Planet Angel is changing with it. The nights keep on getting bigger and better. They always incorporate different genres and host their nights for the people… </P>','0','1','0','53','2008-01-25 12:01:57','64','Frani Heyns','0000-00-00 00:00:00','0','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2008-01-25 11:59:19','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','','pageclass_sfx=\nback_button=\nitem_title=1\nlink_titles=\nintrotext=1\nsection=0\nsection_link=0\ncategory=0\ncategory_link=0\nrating=\nauthor=\ncreatedate=\nmodifydate=\npdf=\nprint=\nemail=\nkeyref=\ndocbook_type=','1','0','3','','','0','0','one-on-one-with-lauren-gold');

Where ordinary lives are touched in extraordinary ways. It is the meeting place for like-minded people and creative individuals. Every month the guestbook is filled with entries – all singing praise to nights that are dedicated to the people, the music and experience. We have decided to highlight one testimonial per month and glimpse into the life of someone who has been touched by Planet Angel.</P>\r\n<P>This month I had the pleasure of meeting Gemma Wells-Colyer. To some she needs no introduction – her natural beauty, creative talent, and love for glitter have been part of Planet Angel for many years. </P>','<P>Gemma went to her first Planet Angel five years ago and immediately fell in love with the experience. She has since decided to become more involved on a creative level and invests in the Planet Angel community with regular face and body painting at events. Her bouncing energy, positive outlook, passion, and contagious smile have resulted in many friendships and the deep connections that are synonymous with nights at Planet Angel.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Give us a brief outline of your life before your first Planet Angel experience.</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>My life mainly consisted of work, work, work and going to mainstream clubs. It generally felt like something was missing. I didn\'t really feel that it was my kind of scene or my kind of music, but as most of my friends went, it was a way of spending time with them. The attitude was just part of the course.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Who introduced you to your first-ever Planet Angel?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>It was my boyfriend Russell, from <A href=\"crew-and-contributors/djs-and-musicians/serotonin-20070330329/\" target=_blank mce_href=\"crew-and-contributors/djs-and-musicians/serotonin-20070330329/\">Serotonin</A>. I\'ve been coming to Planet Angel for nearly as long as we’ve been together. When we first met, he took me to Zap in Brighton, and I fell in love with the music and realised what I had been missing. He then said I would love Planet Angel. He described it as all the best parts of clubbing: the music, the people, the atmosphere all rolled into one.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Describe your first time at Planet Angel.</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>The first time I went to Planet Angel was at the Arches in Southwark Street nearly five years ago. The queue was HUGE! We waited about an hour and a half to get in. But we had entertainment while we waited (I even remember someone with a Glow Staff who has now become a close friend of mine). Everyone was friendly and the vibe was just so different. Once we got inside, my boyfriend introduced me to Pete, who gave me \'the tour\' as he does with most new people. It was so amazing. Everyone was welcoming and friendly. It was like no other place I had ever been to. I spent most of the night dancing my heart out in the Meltdown Room. At the end of the night, I realised I had found what was missing.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>What is your personal view of the entire Planet Angel experience?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>Planet Angel can be many things to different people. For some it is just one night a month where they can be free to just be themselves, with no one questioning or judging them. It’s a release for them and it serves a purpose. This is what it used to be for me. Over the past few years, it has developed into much more than being just a night. Everyone can make Planet Angel what they want. I wanted to get more involved in Planet Angel as I felt I wanted to give something back and be a part of something that is truly amazing. I started doing face/body painting on an ad hoc basis, which has now grown into something more permanent. I thoroughly enjoy being part of what makes Planet Angel work. I’m also now involved in moderating the Forum and other external sites, helping spread the word to like-minded people. Every time I contribute something, I want to contribute more. That is the reason why Planet Angel is so great, you can be someone who appreciates the one night a month, or you can get stuck in up to your elbows… It’s completely your choice.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>What would you say distinguish Planet Angel from other club nights?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>I’ve been to other nights that are similar to Planet Angel. The main difference is the ‘like minded people’, a feeling of community with everyone. Nothing is too much trouble. I love the fact that at Planet Angel you can just be yourself and that you are accepted with open arms (literally). Also, everyone involved with Planet Angel are very positive people who you can connect with. You can contact them directly, there’s no ‘boss’ you have to go to. They always want your ideas on how to improve things and it’s great to know your input is important and most of all appreciated.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>How does Planet Angel contribute to other areas of your life?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>Planet Angel has definitely influenced my life. I have met the most wonderful people who are now my closest friends. I think everyone at some point in their lives stop and take stock of what is important. Being part of Planet Angel made me do this. I realized that work is not everything. I changed my job, started working a little less and made time for friends, family and most importantly myself. This also allowed me to get more involved with Planet Angel, which is very rewarding.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>What is your most memorable Planet Angel moment and why?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>My most memorable moment would have to be when my boyfriend’s band, <A href=\"crew-and-contributors/djs-and-musicians/serotonin-20070330329/\" target=_blank mce_href=\"crew-and-contributors/djs-and-musicians/serotonin-20070330329/\">Serotonin</A>, played the Happening in the Meltdown Room in <A href=\"past-events/2007/the-party-9th-february-2007--review-20070211319/\" target=_blank mce_href=\"past-events/2007/the-party-9th-february-2007--review-20070211319/\">Feb 2007</A>. It had been two years of planning and to see it finally happening was unbelievable. I had been there while they wrote the music - adding bits in, taking stuff out, re-working it. I knew just how much effort had gone into the set. I was so nervous for them, but I knew they would rock! When they started playing, it was amazing. All the hard work had paid off. Everyone went nuts when they played Phoria, including me. I was immensely proud of them and it was the most mind-blowing night I had been part of.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Tell us about one particularly interesting person you’ve met and connected with at Planet Angel.</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>About 18 months ago, I was bouncing around the Meltdown Room and I noticed a guy on his own at the side of the room. Me being me bounced over, I said hi and introduced myself by glittering him. He was called Jay and it was his first Planet Angel. I showed him around and introduced him to my friends. We bounced around for a bit and then went to the chill bar. We clicked straight away and were chatting for ages. I found out he had to work the next day, he’s a massage therapist, so he had to leave a little early. We swapped numbers and I promised to let him know about the next party. In the afternoon, I got a text from Jay saying that he had been massaging people all day, and all around his chair was a ring of glitter! It made him smile. He said thank you for making his first Planet Angel so memorable. The next month, I text him asking if he was coming to the party, and to this day, he says that he didn’t expect it at all. He couldn’t believe that I had remembered him! From this chance meeting, I have met so many of his wonderful friends, and he has met mine. To me, they are my Planet Angel family.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>What do you see happening on the future dance floors of Planet Angel?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>The future of Planet Angel is in our hands. As the months and years pass, it evolves to something else. Not necessarily better or worse, but just something different. The ethos of Planet Angel will always stay the same. There will be new party people coming in and others will depart, but we all have the power to influence what happens. One day Planet Angel will have a permanent space to just be Planet Angel. Until then, we should party like there’s no tomorrow!<BR></P>','1','1','0','1','2008-04-04 15:51:23','64','Frani Heyns','2008-04-04 16:04:36','64','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2008-04-04 15:47:01','0000-00-00 00:00:00','CrewContribs/gemma_120.jpg|left|Gemma and Russ photo|0||bottom||','','pageclass_sfx=\nback_button=\nitem_title=1\nlink_titles=\nintrotext=1\nsection=0\nsection_link=0\ncategory=0\ncategory_link=0\nrating=\nauthor=\ncreatedate=\nmodifydate=\npdf=\nprint=\nemail=\nkeyref=\ndocbook_type=','4','0','37','','','0','624','one-on-one-with-gemma-wells-colyer-');

In it he developed the concept of, and coined the phrase Zippie, with the idea of saving the planet, encouraging a return to consciousness and embracing technology.<BR><BR>In 1990 he was the editor of Evolution, which was the flagship magazine of rave culture, and which gained wide recognition both here and in America, thus paving the way for Fraser\'s next move into dance culture...<BR><BR>In 1993 he founded Megatripolis - one of the first events to recognise the synergy arising from combining New Age ideology with Rave culture. It was the first UK indoor festival where people were exposed to cross-cultural ideas and experiences.<BR><BR>Megatripolis was also a pioneer of the \"Parallel University\", the concept of offering live talks by philosophers, scientists and activists (along with supporting literature) to club-goers. Visits from speakers such as Allen Ginsberg, Terence McKenna, George Monbiot, Howard Marks and Ram Dass were common. Megatripolis spawned a thousand imitators and is perhaps Fraser\'s most enduring legacy.</P>\r\n<P>In the late 1990\'s, Fraser teamed up with alternative theatre writer / actor / director / genius Ken Campbell to create The Warp Experience, a 24 hour stage play by Neil Oram, within a 24 hour party.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The Warp Experience was based at The Drome - the cavernous tunnels under London Bridge Station now known as seOne. After it finished, a number of the production crew went on to create The Synergy Project&nbsp; - now known as Luminopolis.<BR><BR>Fraser\'s trailblazing has led directly to the amazing parties that we run today - he is our spiritual grandfather.<BR><BR>“Deep down this man is a teacher, a spokesman and advocate for the modern urban neopagans who has dedicated his life to the spread of archaic consciousness, specifically through the Youth Culture, which he sees as our last hope for planetary survival. <BR><BR>Like their ancestors and most current mathematicians and physicists, Zippies have abandoned organised rules of logic in favour of reality hacking - riding the waves, watching for trends, keeping an open mind, and staying connected to the flow.&nbsp; For the Zippy, exploration itself is a kind of understanding, and the process of exploring is the meaning of life.”&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P>Douglas Rushkoff: Cyberia (Harper Collins)<BR><BR><BR>Donations to Fraser’s fighting fund:<BR><A href=\"http://www.accessallareas.org/payment\" mce_href=\"http://www.accessallareas.org/payment\">http://www.accessallareas.org/payment</A> <BR><BR>&nbsp; <BR><B>Megatripolis reunion:</B><BR>A benefit event for Fraser Clark<BR>Full Moon, Thursday 13th November 2008<BR>Starting at 10pm and finishing at 6am.<BR>Heaven Night Club, Villiers Street, London WC2N 6NG Phone: 0207 267 8320<BR>Tickets £8.00 on the door<BR>Advance online tickets are available at:<BR>http://www.onlinestall.com/cgi-bin/stall2.pl?act=viewitem&amp;item=1502<BR><BR><BR>Order over the phone Tel: 02072678320 and 02072676148<BR></P>','1','1','0','53','2008-11-12 17:30:32','65','Angel & Others','2008-11-12 18:00:51','64','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2008-11-12 17:28:04','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','','pageclass_sfx=\nback_button=\nitem_title=1\nlink_titles=\nintrotext=1\nsection=0\nsection_link=0\ncategory=0\ncategory_link=0\nrating=\nauthor=\ncreatedate=\nmodifydate=\npdf=\nprint=\nemail=\nkeyref=\ndocbook_type=','4','0','1','','','0','475','fraser-clark-fighting-fund');

It really had that warehouse feel and the event was basically lots of different groups of people collaborating to put on a huge event called the Warp - which was conceived by Fraser Clark. It was a great time. \r\n<P align=justify mce_keep=\"true\">So for us this warehouse Party was real blast from the past, not only were we back in a car park, we were working with other like-minded organisations again which was a real treat!&nbsp; Both Wonderland and the 491 Gallery provided a fantastic contribution to the Party, both adding a creative input that gelled perfectly with Planet Angel’s.&nbsp; So big thanks to both organisations and particularly well done to the 491 for running the cafe all night under some quite difficult circumstances at points!</P>\r\n<P align=justify mce_keep=\"true\">&nbsp;</P>\r\n<DIV style=\"FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0pt 10pt 0px 0px\">{jgxtimg src:=[images/stories/gallery2/20080524/emma_bennet_20080524/emma_bennett_20080524_003.jpg] width:=[200]}</DIV>And the music;&nbsp; how well did that work out!

Yet, it sparked some controversy and interest on the forum. I decided to delve a little deeper and found the right answers to prove that a change can be as good as a holiday.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Why did you initially decide to change the rooms around?</STRONG><BR>There were a few reasons really and the idea was not only ours. The music team has been suggesting it for a while. We wanted to keep things fresh and see how the different styles of music would work in the other room. We had an idea it would work well!</P>','<P><STRONG>You’ve received a lot of good feedback on the forum. Did you get the response you were hoping for? And is this true for both rooms?</STRONG><BR>Overall the feedback is positive, but as usual not everyone agrees. To be honest we didn’t really want any particular response – we just wanted to see if we could improve things. We kind of knew that everyone would let us know what they thought in no uncertain terms! It seems that the feedback is very balanced in terms of the rooms. I.e. most people appear to think both styles of music sound better in the swapped rooms – the sound systems suit the way things are now.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>You first swapped the rooms for the September party and decided to do it again in October. Would you say the response is the same after two months and will you do it again in November?</STRONG><BR>We’re thinking of keeping it the way it is – for now at least. That being said, we may consider swapping them back in a while and maybe change them over from time to time. Although as mentioned before, we do think the sound systems actually suit the music better this way round. </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>How would you describe the atmosphere in both rooms after the room swap? <BR></STRONG>There have been some strange unpredicted effects! One guy was clearly just used to going in the Meltdown Room and dancing to trance in that room because half way into the night when we first swapped the rooms over, he went up to the DJ and said: “Is this what you call breaks?”.</P>\r\n<P>The Meltdown Room definitely has a slightly different feel. Being able to see people on different physical levels when dancing to trance is a great thing. It works really well with that type of music and creates a sense of unity. Whereas with the eclectic music in the Funky Lounge, the one level floor seems to create a great atmosphere with people really going for it!</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Do have any other major changes in mind for the near future?</STRONG><BR>We’re always looking to improve and we’re currently looking at the decor end of things. It is a huge task though. If you do things properly, décor is expensive and requires a lot of thought. It’s not just about the design, but also the effect it will have on people and how we’ll rig it… But that’s what we do!</P>\r\n<P>We’d love to hear your views.

Our media is full of stories of potential kidnappings, Suicide bomber threats and the spectre of the Taliban.<br /></b><br /><br />','My first impression was the friendliness and welcome the people of\r\nKabul have for anyone who arrives. For on first impressions it is a\r\nscary place, full of high walled razored wired buildings, men with\r\nKalashnikovs and bright green pickups sporting menacing machine guns.&nbsp;\r\nBut welcome I feel. Innumerable cups of chai sabz - green tea- with\r\ndried fruits and a politeness that we seem to be losing in dear old\r\nBlighty.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI am staying at the Gandymak, run by an ex cameraman, and a sort of\r\nhomage to the great game that has been played out by the various\r\ninvaders of the last 2500 years. Flak jackets and tin hats are neatly\r\nlined up in the corridor for the journos going down south - not me -&nbsp;\r\nand 19th Century rifles present themselves at the front door with a\r\nfine example hanging from my wall. The room looks out to TV mountain\r\nand its masts and receivers that broadcast the show I am making called\r\nAfghan Star, the pop idol contest of Afghanistan. And what a privilege\r\nthis has been to see into the lives of ordinary Afghanis living and\r\ngoing through their week waiting for the day when the thing that lights\r\nup their life comes on air and gives them hope for the future. It might\r\nsound crazy, but so much depends on the young people of this country to\r\nbe able to express themselves. Men and women cannot still dance in\r\npublic... in fact there is no way to DANCE.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt’s strange how I had no interest in the pop star shows in the UK,\r\njudging them as trite entertainment and same old same old. Here the\r\nstakes are much higher and the show is being used to unite and push\r\nforward the rebuilding and reconciliation of the country. All tribes\r\nand regions are competing, some risking their lives to get to Kabul. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOut of 2000 men, only 3 women applied and were given instant place to\r\nbe in the first rounds. This is the bravest decision imaginable and one\r\nof the women who has just been voted off now cannot go back to her home\r\ntown as her headdress fell down while she was on stage. She has no\r\nregrets and is such a brave and expressive person and part of the\r\nmovement to bring back the lost freedoms of expression from war and\r\nintolerance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost nights I stay in the hotel. After a shooting at a five star hotel\r\na few weeks ago the NGO\'s, contractors and UN are on a lockdown so the\r\nfew bars and restaurants are either empty or shut. If I fancy a drink\r\nthen there’s always the Hare and Hounds down in the cellar...&nbsp; a\r\ncomplete pub with beer mats and beamed ceilings, shame the smoking ban\r\nhasn\'t been extended over here and a reminder of how horrid it used to\r\nbe in the UK. It\'s an interesting place to meet the ones who do make it\r\nout of their compounds. There are the usual journalists, the architects\r\nthat are not short of work, charity workers and private security guys.\r\nOne night I met an Australian who not only said **** off every other\r\nphrase, but was intent on taking me to Kandahar for no good reason that\r\nhe said he could. Topics of diamond mines in Africa, losing his\r\nbuddies, and sticking up for the Afghan people and I\'ll get you to\r\nKandahar in one peace (sic) again and again became a blur by the time I\r\nleft at four. I think his name was something like Shimbi, but all I\r\ncould remember was calling him \"Sinbin\" and him calling me \"**** Off\".<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe were supposed to go to the North to film one of the contestants\r\ntoday. Got up in the dark, stumbled around, drove through the snow with\r\nour driver and bodyguard to the airport. We waited for news, plane\r\ndelayed, so we turned the seats around in the van put a suitcase flat\r\nfor more chai sabz and two packets of Funny Cake and another two\r\npackets of Cake Funny. Exactly the same thing if you like madeira cake\r\nfor breakfast. Well the flight has been cancelled so I have the first\r\nfree day to go off and Shop. And what shops, and so few customers. Like\r\nat the City Centre, a marble mall where I looked down the other day and\r\nsaw I had left muddy footprints from my boots on the white tiles, a boy\r\nfollowing behind me with a mop. There is money flooding into the city\r\nand I suppose it makes it way out to the people. But it is still\r\ndistressing to see so many people begging between the lines of cars in\r\nthe traffic jams and sooty faced children holding up cans with some\r\nsmoky incense for good luck.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen the snow melts, there is mud everywhere with teams of orange\r\nsuited workers shovelling and sweeping it off the roads. The city is\r\nclean and tidy and I am beginning to understand the pride the people of\r\nKabul have. So much to do. The bullet and rocket holes in the building\r\nare the testament to the chaos that reigned here. Their houses, places\r\nof culture and entertainment have been destroyed and I can only hope\r\nthat the process of reconciliation and building a secure future\r\ncontinues. Now I think I understand why the troops and NGO\'s are here\r\nand why the people I have met want them to stay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWell thanks for reading this and sharing some of my thoughts and ramblings. I trust you are well and wish you all the best.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhil<br />\r\nx','0','1','0','53','2008-04-16 15:23:43','65','Phil Stebbing','0000-00-00 00:00:00','0','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2008-04-16 15:22:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','','pageclass_sfx=\nback_button=\nitem_title=1\nlink_titles=\nintrotext=1\nsection=0\nsection_link=0\ncategory=0\ncategory_link=0\nrating=\nauthor=\ncreatedate=\nmodifydate=\npdf=\nprint=\nemail=\nkeyref=\ndocbook_type=','1','0','2','','','0','0','greetings-from-kabul');

And you\'re invited! We\'ve pinned down a wikkid funky underground venue in Central London, it\'s hardly been used for parties and has a lovely feel. It\'s a fresh and exciting very cool set of arches... We’ll have an entrance hall, a cosy Bar Room which also contains the shop. There’s the Funky Lounge with a huge arched ceiling and off there is the Wonderland Library chillout area complete with cafe! On the other side is the Meltdown Room – a great space to party in... And there’s a huge covered outdoor area for a smoke and some fresh air.</P>\r\n<P class=second_para>Not only do we have a particularly excellent DJ line up, we’re also very pleased to announce a special appearance to bring the house down... Prepare yourselves for hard-hitting breakbeats, dirty thumping electro and twisted psychedelic sounds... In conjunction with our friends at Funkatech Records we’re very pleased to present a <STRONG>rare and exclusive</STRONG> live 75 minute performance by our special guests <STRONG>Far Too Loud</STRONG>! If you’ve not heard these guys and you like it dirty, you’re in for a treat... This is an exclusive live set just for this Party, you wont have heard it before, and you won’t hear it again! Catch them in the Funky Lounge at 1 am.<BR><BR>The Meltdown Room also sees a fantastic live performance for the Happening at 2:45. We’re very pleased to present Hannah – performing a unique belly dance form blending tradition with a hint of anarchy; this is not your average belly dancing!<BR><BR>Each room promises an excellent musical journey based on the theme of ‘the best of a decade ’... In the Meltdown room that spans the best of Progressive and Classic Trance with a ‘Best of 2008’ set moving on to Euphoric and finally Psy trance. It’s going to be awesome! In the Funky Lounge we open with an Old Skool set which proved so popular at the <A style=\"COLOR: #ffffff\" href=\"past-events/2008/party20080524-20080527461/\" target=_blank>Warehouse Party</A> in May, moving through Funky Breaks, Uplifting Drum &amp; Bass and closing with Dirty Breaks...

I’d always been into the trance but when I heard the music played in the Meltdown Room, it was like magic: the music was so fresh and exciting, and as soon as I heard it, I knew I had to get involved in the events. I played my first guest DJ slot in 2004 and after regular repeat bookings over the next few years, I had the huge honour of being appointed a resident DJ in early 2007.</P>','<P><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/CrewContribs/jurrane-press-shot-7_185.jpg\" width=\"185\" height=\"247\" style=\"float: right;\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"Jurrane Photo\" title=\"Jurrane Photo\" border=\"0\" />I DJ professionally, and have played for many of the biggest trance parties in the UK. I also co-produce with fellow Planet Angel resident Sly One, who’s a great friend: we’ve over a dozen releases between us and our music has been supported and playlisted by some of the biggest names in the industry. You can buy our music on <A href=\"http://www.audiojelly.com/\" mce_href=\"http://www.audiojelly.com/\">www.audiojelly.com</A>, <A href=\"http://www.beatport.com/\" mce_href=\"http://www.beatport.com/\">www.beatport.com</A>, <A href=\"http://www.trackitdown.net/\" mce_href=\"http://www.trackitdown.net/\">www.trackitdown.net</A> and many other download sites. </P>\r\n<P>For me, the music in the Meltdown Room is all about excitement and energy. Great trance music has that ability to make people move and dance no matter how tired they are or what time of the night it is, and it’s music like that which fuels my DJ sets. I love the pumping, bouncy, uplifting side of trance but I’m equally at home playing the early night music where groove and basslines are more important than those hands-in-the-air moments.</P>\r\n<P>I consider myself a better DJ because of Planet Angel’s influence. The privilege of being a monthly resident means I have the challenge of being versatile enough to cover a wide variety of set times, and also the ability to play more than one music style across the various rooms. Playing my first Chill Bar set was a lot of fun: I got to play a whole different style of music and the feedback from the partygoers was really positive. My roots will always be in the Meltdown Room sound though and I get the biggest thrill from playing to Planet Angel’s partygoers – still the best crowds anywhere! </P>\r\n<P>If you want to find out more about me, please check out my website at <A href=\"http://www.jurrane.com/\" mce_href=\"http://www.jurrane.com/\">www.jurrane.com</A>.

Our media is full of stories of potential kidnappings, Suicide bomber threats and the spectre of the Taliban.</P>','<P><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/NewsArticles/hillside-low_160.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"120\" style=\"float: right;\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"hillside\" title=\"hillside\" border=\"0\" />My first impression was the friendliness and welcome the people of Kabul have for anyone who arrives. For on first impressions it is a scary place, full of high walled razored wired buildings, men with Kalashnikovs and bright green pickups sporting menacing machine guns.&nbsp; But welcome I feel. Innumerable cups of chai sabz - green tea- with dried fruits and a politeness that we seem to be losing in dear old Blighty.</P>\r\n<P><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/NewsArticles/musket-low_140.jpg\" width=\"140\" height=\"187\" style=\"float: left;\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"musket\" title=\"musket\" border=\"0\" />I am staying at the Gandymak, run by an ex cameraman, and a sort of homage to the great game that has been played out by the various invaders of the last 2500 years. Flak jackets and tin hats are neatly lined up in the corridor for the journos going down south - not me -&nbsp; and 19th Century rifles present themselves at the front door with a fine example hanging from my wall. The room looks out to TV mountain and its masts and receivers that broadcast the show I am making called Afghan Star, the pop idol contest of Afghanistan. And what a privilege this has been to see into the lives of ordinary Afghanis living and going through their week waiting for the day when the thing that lights up their life comes on air and gives them hope for the future. It might sound crazy, but so much depends on the young people of this country to be able to express themselves. Men and women cannot still dance in public... in fact there is no way to DANCE.</P>\r\n<P>It’s strange how I had no interest in the pop star shows in the UK, judging them as trite entertainment and same old same old. Here the stakes are much higher and the show is being used to unite and push forward the rebuilding and reconciliation of the country. All tribes and regions are competing, some risking their lives to get to Kabul.&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/NewsArticles/setera_170.jpg\" width=\"170\" height=\"218\" style=\"float: right;\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"setera\" title=\"setera\" border=\"0\" />Out of 2000 men, only 3 women applied and were given instant place to be in the first rounds. This is the bravest decision imaginable and one of the women who has just been voted off now cannot go back to her home town as her headdress fell down while she was on stage. She has no regrets and is such a brave and expressive person and part of the movement to bring back the lost freedoms of expression from war and intolerance.</P>\r\n<P><img src=\"http://www.planetangel.net/images/stories/NewsArticles/busy-street-low_130.jpg\" width=\"130\" height=\"173\" style=\"float: left;\" hspace=\"6\" alt=\"busy street\" title=\"busy street\" border=\"0\" />Most nights I stay in the hotel. After a shooting at a five star hotel a few weeks ago the NGO\'s, contractors and UN are on a lockdown so the few bars and restaurants are either empty or shut. If I fancy a drink then there’s always the Hare and Hounds down in the cellar...&nbsp; a complete pub with beer mats and beamed ceilings, shame the smoking ban hasn\'t been extended over here and a reminder of how horrid it used to be in the UK. It\'s an interesting place to meet the ones who do make it out of their compounds. There are the usual journalists, the architects that are not short of work, charity workers and private security guys. One night I met an Australian who not only said **** off every other phrase, but was intent on taking me to Kandahar for no good reason that he said he could. Topics of diamond mines in Africa, losing his buddies, and sticking up for the Afghan people and I\'ll get you to Kandahar in one peace (sic) again and again became a blur by the time I left at four. I think his name was something like Shimbi, but all I could remember was calling him \"Sinbin\" and him calling me \"**** Off\".</P>\r\n<P>We were supposed to go to the North to film one of the contestants today. Got up in the dark, stumbled around, drove through the snow with our driver and bodyguard to the airport. We waited for news, plane delayed, so we turned the seats around in the van put a suitcase flat for more chai sabz and two packets of Funny Cake and another two packets of Cake Funny. Exactly the same thing if you like madeira cake for breakfast. Well the flight has been cancelled so I have the first free day to go off and Shop. And what shops, and so few customers. Like at the City Centre, a marble mall where I looked down the other day and saw I had left muddy footprints from my boots on the white tiles, a boy following behind me with a mop. There is money flooding into the city and I suppose it makes it way out to the people. But it is still distressing to see so many people begging between the lines of cars in the traffic jams and sooty faced children holding up cans with some smoky incense for good luck.</P>\r\n<P>When the snow melts, there is mud everywhere with teams of orange suited workers shovelling and sweeping it off the roads. The city is clean and tidy and I am beginning to understand the pride the people of Kabul have. So much to do. The bullet and rocket holes in the building are the testament to the chaos that reigned here. Their houses, places of culture and entertainment have been destroyed and I can only hope that the process of reconciliation and building a secure future continues. Now I think I understand why the troops and NGO\'s are here and why the people I have met want them to stay.</P>\r\n<P>Well thanks for reading this and sharing some of my thoughts and ramblings. I trust you are well and wish you all the best.</P>\r\n<P>Phil<BR>x<BR></P>','1','1','0','1','2008-05-28 01:00:00','64','Phil Stebbing','2008-06-04 17:15:39','64','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2008-05-22 11:08:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','NewsArticles/hillside-low_160.jpg|right|hillside|0||bottom||\r\nNewsArticles/musket-low_140.jpg|left|musket|0||bottom||\r\nNewsArticles/setera_170.jpg|right|setera|0||bottom||\r\nNewsArticles/busy-street-low_130.jpg|left|busy street|0||bottom||','','pageclass_sfx=\nback_button=\nitem_title=1\nlink_titles=\nintrotext=1\nsection=0\nsection_link=0\ncategory=0\ncategory_link=0\nrating=\nauthor=\ncreatedate=\nmodifydate=\npdf=\nprint=\nemail=\nkeyref=\ndocbook_type=','4','0','32','','','0','512','greetings-from-kabul');

The land is used with permission from one of their dads who owns it!</P>\r\n<P>There is a fun line-up of bands and a few different areas like a main stage with bands and DJs and an alternative tent with acoustic music and fun stuff to do. It sounds like they’re putting a lot of effort into it.</P>\r\n<P>The whole event is a charity fund raiser and normal ticket price is £40. However, as we were only going camping we’ve agreed a special camping rate of £12 for the weekend which is what it would have cost at the camp site we usually use. They have said tho, that they’d really prefer people to arrive on Friday night – they don’t want the road to the field being used on Saturday night and drawing attention.</P>\r\n<P>The other thing we’ve agreed is that we’ll run a funky Planet Angel Bar!&nbsp; It’s our weekend off so there’s no pressure but we reckon it’ll be great fun and good experience!&nbsp; We’re thinking a bigger affair than last year... They’ll supply a cool marquee and electricity and we’re thinking lets do it up big time. Mick and I are up for building a proper U shaped bar area out of pallets like last year so we can serve drinks to people sitting at the bar.&nbsp; The aim is to sell reasonably priced drinks to provide the facility for the event and get good experience rather than aim to make profit.&nbsp; We can take a system and some decks and come up with a cool DJ line-up and we’re even thinking we could do a big BBQ or something for the Saturday night.&nbsp; The bar area would also make a communal eating area – that worked really well last year.&nbsp; Also we’ve agreed to build and manage a fire at the Bar.</P>\r\n<P>They are very keen for us to go and join them and we reckon it’ll be a great laugh and some more cool experience of doing something outside and running a bar...</P>\r\n<P>As ever the idea is that we all chip in a bit and have a laugh so please let us know what you’re up for doing! Lauren’s sorting out the invites and Angel’s working out the drinks prices and logistics and music schedule so we’ve got that covered... Oh and kids are welcome!</P>\r\n<P>And remember you can invite two friends as well! Please note places are limited and are offered on a first come first served basis, so, to ensure your place, please make sure you confirm by email only...to <A href=\"mailto:lauren@planetangel.net\">lauren@planetangel.net</A>. We need your full name and a mobile number and the full name of your partner and friends.&nbsp; We can’t confirm your place without that info!</P>\r\n<P>We’ll be issuing wristbands on the Friday so please have your money ready then... As mentioned this is a charity fund-raising event for Cancer Research UK so if you’d like to donate a bit more feel free. </P>\r\n<P>We’ll update this page regularly as things develop ...</P>\r\n<P>In answer to a couple of questions...</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Re arriving on Saturday</STRONG>: the entrance to the filed is via a small track between a row of houses. The neighbours know that people will be arriving on Friday evening but the idea is that people don’t arrive on Saturday evening as well.&nbsp; So, if you really can’t arrive on Friday evening, please arrive on Saturday during the morning/midday and please try to car pool to keep traffic to a minimum. The same goes for people leaving please don’t plan to leave on Saturday night!</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Re Dogs</STRONG>: no problem if they’re well behaved and constantly being looked after by the owners and that their crap is picked up!</P>\r\n<H3 align=center>And... ....

Unfortunately they’re often the hardest sets to get right and are the most important to the overall success of the party. Why? Because they set the tone of the party, dictate the pace of the night and influence what all the DJs afterwards will play. </P>\r\n<P>If you’re the warm-up DJ and you play too loud, hard and fast, the crowd will be tired before midnight. Hammer the anthems and everybody will be bored of hearing them once all the other DJs have played them as well. A good warm-up set takes skill, control, patience – and a bit of psychology. This article suggests a few ideas to help you play that perfect opening set. </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Set the mood.</STRONG> Mood is very important because very few people arrive at a party and start dancing immediately. They want to meet their friends, have a drink, chat, check out the surroundings, put their coat away; all manner of different things until they want to have a dance. A good DJ recognises this and doesn’t go for the big tracks from the start in an effort to fill the dancefloor. Instead, he or she recognises the need to create a welcoming mood ready for partygoers when they start dancing. </P>\r\n<P>Next time you get to a club early, watch the dancefloor. People don’t just rush on to it straight away; they often stand on the edges, chilling out, chatting and getting into the mood for dancing. Nodding and foot tapping are the signs they’re appreciating the music and, to the warm-up DJ, these non-verbal signs are the equivalent of those 3am “hands in the air” moments for the peak-time sets. Why? Because it means those people on the edges of the dancefloor are enjoying what the DJ’s doing and they’ll be dancing soon enough. </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Keep the volume and BPM’s down.</STRONG> One of the most intimidating things you can find in a club is an empty dancefloor pumping out relentlessly fast music at an ear-splitting volume. At the beginning of the night, people want to be gently welcomed onto a dancefloor, not scared away from it. </P>\r\n<P>Because of this, slow is good for a warm-up set. No-one rushes on to a dancefloor and starts stomping away full-pelt. People respond to gradual increases in energy, particularly at the start of the night. It’s also a good idea to keep the volume levels relatively low as well, so people can still hear themselves talk. As more people arrive on the dancefloor, you can slowly bring the pace and volume up. </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Don’t worry about the crowd.</STRONG> Playing a warm-up set can be a little daunting because you’re often playing to an empty room to begin with and, if people don’t start dancing straight away, newer DJs worry they’re doing something wrong. Remember: people don’t start dancing in clubs immediately and just because they’re staying away, it doesn’t mean they don’t like your music. Instead, they’ve got other things to do before they start dancing. As the DJ, it’s your job to welcome them on to the dancefloor when they’re ready. </P>\r\n<P>You may also find that at the start of the night people arrive on the dancefloor, dance for a couple of tracks and then head back to the bar. Again, this isn’t a comment on your music: it’s just a sign they’re not ready to stomp away for the rest of the night. They’ve shown they want to dance and they’ll be back. </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Slow and steady wins the race.</STRONG> The secret of a good warm up set is a gradual increase in momentum and energy. Think of the set as a gentle upward energy curve. One you’ve got people on the dancefloor, gradually up the pressure levels with each track. Your aim should be to get people’s heads nodding, toes tapping and groove going until they can resist no longer and can’t help but start dancing. So many Planet Angel parties have started this way with the warm-up DJ increasing the momentum barely perceptibly, gradually drawing people on to the dancefloor until it’s full and then plays a “let’s go!” track – and the room’s set for the rest of the night. </P>\r\n<P>Just remember: don’t do this too quickly or you’ll wear the dancers out. Often a truly great warm-up set is all about holding back. You’re looking for a patient, controlled set that reaches its peak only when the dancefloor is full and ready to go absolutely crazy. </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Play music people recognise.</STRONG> Familiarity is a powerful thing in music. If you want to gently entice people on to the dancefloor, lure them in with stuff they’ll know. One of the great ways to get people dancing is to make them realise “wow… I haven’t heard that for years!” or “hey, I know this…. and it’s really good!” Vocal tracks are often also a good bet, for this very reason. </P>\r\n<P>Remember: you’re starting the party. If you’re the warm-up DJ, you’re getting the party started - literally. If the crowd is small to begin with, engage with them personally. Make eye contact, smile, and show them you’re having a good time. Enthusiasm and enjoyment is infectious: if you\'re having fun, so will your crowd. </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Enjoy yourself!</STRONG> Many experienced DJs will tell you the warm-up set can be the most rewarding set of the night to play. It’s no easy thing to start with an empty club and transform it into a heaving dancefloor full of up-for-it party people. Any DJ can take over a packed room at 3am and hammer out the anthems.

With his core philosophy to live for love and creativity, he blended right in and has attended just about every party since then. This month Tim deserves the spotlight – he has just published his first novel on fictiondirect. Sit back, relax and join us as the London-based writer guides to his inspiring world of writing. </P>','<P><STRONG>You have just published your first book, Shane. Can you give us a sneak preview and tell us more about the storyline? <BR></STRONG>I\'d say Shane is a modern day western. The storyline comes from the 1954 Oscar winning film of the same name starring Alan Ladd. In the film, Shane arrives at an isolated farm in the American West. The family is harassed by the local big cattle rancher who wants their land. What I\'ve done is take that situation and plant it in the claustrophobic atmosphere of a council estate. Shane is the stranger, the outsider. He arrives and deals with the problem in a way that members of the community cannot - then leaves.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>You’ve had raving reviews so far. Readers describe Shane as “raw, edgy and convincing”; “a gaspingly easy read”; and “fabulous and edgy”. What inspired you to write this story?</STRONG><BR>I wanted to create a character who is outside of everyday society. A murderer, a criminal, someone who blurs the moral boundaries, yet someone the reader can\'t help rooting for. I also wanted to write a book the reader couldn\'t put down. So far I have been really pleased with the response.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Tell us more about the actual writing process. How long did it take to complete the book? Did you know exactly how the story would unfold before you started or did the idea gradually develop while you were writing?</STRONG><BR>Shane took me about a year to write. All I knew when I started was, he would arrive in a taxi and leave in a taxi. Oh yes, and he would meet a family. I write without notes and keep the plot in my head as I go, so it can grow organically. I turn the laptop on everyday, correct what I did the day before, maybe add or take away a few words to make it flow better and then I start writing again. I put my people in situations and the plot turns on what they say or do and I never quite know exactly what will happen next. I like this style of writing, because it keeps it very alive for me - and I hope for the reader too. I test my work by reading it out loud. If it doesn\'t read well, I cut and rewrite.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>What, in your opinion, are the most important elements to consider when you write a book?</STRONG><BR>A cushion for your seat, as you spend a lot of time sitting down and the need to write. Writing a book isn\'t all about inspiration. It\'s about applying yourself over long periods of time. I don\'t know about other writers, but I want to grab you and pull into the world of my book.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Was it always one of your dreams to publish a book?</STRONG><BR>I\'ve been writing for years but I earn my money as a carpenter. Writing isn\'t a hobby. It is what I do. Carpentry and all the other things I do in my life are by the by, the things I do to survive so I can write. Of course I want success, I\'d be an idiot to pretend I didn\'t. But it is the writing, the process of it that I love.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>You say that love and creativity are two of the most important things in your life. Tell us more about this inspiring revelation.</STRONG> <BR>Inspiring revelation? Now you\'re scaring me! For me at least, love and creativity go hand in hand. Creativity isn\'t about writing a book or painting a picture, it\'s about how you live your life - it\'s a positive energy, as is love in all its forms. </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>You also believe that your writing has helped you to change, survive and love. Can you tell us more about this?</STRONG><BR>As a writer you look at all sides of a question or situation, which means your own views and morality are always up for question. You can\'t help but look at your own ways of acting and thinking and that hopefully allows you to become less judgemental, maybe less dogmatic. Life is long, if you can change a bit as you go along, you can usually survive. I don’t want to have the same thoughts I had 20 years ago. I want to be open and adaptable.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>You are the founder of fictiondirect. Tell us more about this business venture and can other writers get in contact with you to publish their work?</STRONG><BR>I wanted to take control of the means of production. I wanted a way to get to the reader direct. But a business venture? I\'m not expecting to make any money with this. In fact, with Shane now, I need to sell about another 30 books to break even. If I manage that, I\'ll be happy. What fictiondirect has given me is a platform, a way out into the world.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I would be interested in other writers contacting me. They can do that through the website <A href=\"http://www.fictiondirect.com/\" mce_href=\"http://www.fictiondirect.com/\">www.fictiondirect.com</A> – there is an email connection. I would only be interested in completed work, novels mostly as that is where my interest is. Also they would have to be self-motivated, because as I said, fictiondirect is a platform and a small one at the moment.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Can we expect another book from you soon?</STRONG><BR>Yes - there will be three Shane books. I\'ve recently finished Shane Dos and I’m getting it ready for the printer just now - with a mid March publication date. I\'ve also started writing the third book, Shane B I T D.&nbsp; Shane Dos is set in Spain, 6 years earlier than Shane and in Shane B I T D you met Shane as a twelve year old. </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>And finally – tell us more about you and Planet Angel. When were you introduced to the party for the first time and how would you describe the experience?</STRONG> <BR>I went to the first party at Imperial Gardens, Camberwell. It blew me away. The sheer openness of the people was fantastic. I went to practically every party after that night – up until about two years ago. Even now most of my friends are people I met at Planet Angel. Long may it thrive and bring joy to people the way it did to me.</P>','1','1','0','1','2008-12-04 17:08:02','64','Frani Heyns','2008-12-04 17:32:34','64','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2008-12-04 17:04:19','0000-00-00 00:00:00','NewsArticles/timorchard.jpg|right|Tim Photo|0||bottom||','','pageclass_sfx=\nback_button=\nitem_title=1\nlink_titles=\nintrotext=1\nsection=0\nsection_link=0\ncategory=0\ncategory_link=0\nrating=\nauthor=\ncreatedate=\nmodifydate=\npdf=\nprint=\nemail=\nkeyref=\ndocbook_type=','4','0','12','','','0','292','getting-under-the-skin-of-shanes-creator');

Where ordinary lives are touched in extraordinary ways. It is the meeting place for like-minded people and creative individuals. Every month the guestbook is filled with entries – all singing praise to nights that are dedicated to the people, the music and experience. </P>\r\n<P>We have decided to highlight one testimonial per month and glimpse into the life of someone who has been touched by Planet Angel.</P>','<P>Ian Salter’s positive presence has been a part of Planet Angel since the London Bridge days. He is a familiar face on the dance floor and a man of many talents. Without holding back, he let me into his world and revealed the many dimensions of his interesting life. Not only is he a dedicated father, but he also spends three days a week at one of London’s top investment banks. His weekends are varied and an exciting mixture of time with those closest to him, time behind the decks and time rigging or setting up lights for various events. </P>\r\n<P>Planet Angel is now an integral part of Ian’s life. His involvement over the years has strengthened and built many work and personal relationships. Sit back and relax. It’s time for Ian’s story. </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Give us a glimpse into your normal day-to-day life.</STRONG> </P>\r\n<P>My life is really split into three parts. Monday to Wednesday I work for a major US Investment Bank in the City of London developing IT Strategy. Thursday and Friday and alternate weekends I am a stay-at-home-dad for my four kids although the eldest are not around so much anymore. On other weekends I am usually out and about dancing, rigging, occasionally DJing or at an after party somewhere. My 87- year-old dad has just come to live with me.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>How would you describe life before your first Planet Angel experience?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>I was in a failing relationship. I had a good job, but very little confidence in my ability to do it. I didn’t really have a great relationship with my kids. I did used to go out drinking with mates for a break, but I had knocked this on the head because I couldn’t deal with the hangovers and the complaints of my partner. My circle of friends was getting smaller and smaller.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Who introduced you to your first-ever Planet Angel?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>My mates Robbie (Robert Jacobs) and Ersin (Ramiz)</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Describe your first time at Planet Angel.</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>I had been to Planet Angel once or twice before I separated from my kids’ mum, but only for an hour or so after the pub. I thought if I get into this it really would be the end of our relationship.</P>\r\n<P>The first Planet Angel I remember was about a week after we actually did separate. It was under the arches near London Bridge. I was feeling quite nervous. I remember coming through the door quite early and walking through to the Chill Bar with a mate. Then an absolutely stunning Brazilian woman shouted my name and came over to give me a big hug. It was a friend’s brother’s ex-wife. She had been to Planet Angel before and was infected with the spirit of the place. I danced my socks off all night with different groups of people and I have never looked back since.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>What is your personal view of the entire Planet Angel experience?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>These day people are often so driven by life goals that they forget to party. Planet Angel is an excellent night to catch up with friends, dance, meet new people and do all the other things that makes a great party.</P>\r\n<P>On the work side of things -&nbsp; I love the “Not-for-Profit” ethos. I get a real feel of working together as a group that aims to put on something special every time we organise a party.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>What would you say distinguishes Planet Angel from other club nights?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>The friendliness of the place is the big difference. I think the word-of-mouth approach has made a huge difference. Although having lots of activities (like Lego etc.) which encourages people to talk naturally.</P>\r\n<P>It’s not that long since I started coming, but it almost seems as if a new generation has started coming recently. What is great about this, is that the friendly attitude seems to have been passed on from one generation to the next.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>How did you get involved in the Planet Angel events and what do you do?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>I noticed a poster in the toilets asking for volunteers. I spoke to JFS on the door - he took my details and Pete rang me. They needed décor riggers and this is how I started. I have learnt a wide range of things now. I rig décor or lighting for Planet Angel, but sometimes do audio stuff for other venues as well. </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>How does Planet Angel contribute to other areas of your life?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>Getting involved as crew for Planet Angel led me on to volunteer for other events like Whirly, Loop and the 491 gallery. Working with lots of different people, both at Planet Angel and elsewhere, gave me renewed confidence in my abilities and myself. This fed back into my work and my relationships with people, especially my relationships with my kids.</P>\r\n<P>At the Planet Angel *Chilled* events we used to have a couple of years ago, my kids saw a different side to their dad. Since then the youngest three have all rigged with me at some event or another. Sam, my 12 year old, was even official crew (with a badge and everything) at the last *Chilled* where he set up and hosted the game cube. Unfortunately he was stripped of his crew badge for chucking water bombs – but that is 12-year-old boys for you!</P>\r\n<P>Most bizarrely, especially at my age, is that I have recently starting DJing. This was something I had never even thought of before I came to Planet Angel.</P>\r\n<P><BR><STRONG>What is your most memorable Planet Angel moment?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>There have been a lot… The one described above comes pretty high. There’s also another one I remember in particular that captures the spirit of Planet Angel for me. </P>\r\n<P>I was sitting at the back of the funky lounge arch when Rogue Element’s - Breathe came on. I love this tune so I headed straight for the dance floor. I had been really going for it for a while when I noticed a woman also dancing hard next to me. We carried on dancing madly till the end of the tune. At that point we shook hands and walked off in different directions. We didn’t need to say anything! </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Tell us about one particularly interesting person you’ve met and connected with at Planet Angel.</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>It’s really hard to just pick one person. Most people I’ve met have been interesting in one way or another. I suppose one of the people I have connected with the most is Andi Hall. Lots of times we’ve ended up doing the blue run* together, popping into Sainsbury’s on the way back to stock up on beer or tobacco before heading off home or to an after party - depending on what we could talk each other into.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>What do you see happening on the future dance floors of Planet Angel?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>My kids and their mates - Maxime is 18 next February and Tegan is 18 in November 2010!</P>\r\n<P>* <EM>The blue run is one of the last jobs at the end of a party and involves getting all of the kit back to the storage depot and packed away.</EM> </P>','1','1','0','1','2008-10-02 14:54:55','64','Frani Heyns','2008-10-02 15:04:14','64','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2008-10-02 14:49:30','0000-00-00 00:00:00','NewsArticles/iansalter_130.jpg|right|Ian Salter Photo|0||bottom||','','pageclass_sfx=\nback_button=\nitem_title=1\nlink_titles=\nintrotext=1\nsection=0\nsection_link=0\ncategory=0\ncategory_link=0\nrating=\nauthor=\ncreatedate=\nmodifydate=\npdf=\nprint=\nemail=\nkeyref=\ndocbook_type=','4','0','22','','','0','310','one-on-one-with-ian-salter');

I was at Ravelation and came across the lovely Planet Angel team in the Courtyard. I was so taken with U-4-IC that I bought his collection of tapes there and then. </p>','<p>I was lucky enough to meet up with the founders of the Love Squad (Shelley and Andy) who came up to me and introduced themselves and said they had seen me around and wanted to say hi. I was struck by the friendly people and fantastic atmosphere - I loved every moment of that night and went home with a warm feeling inside. I was then invited to the first party at the Arches in June 2000 and went along and danced all night long. I have to say that dancing all night long is one thing that I love to do and this was the perfect music and people to dance with - AMAZING. I got close and close to the crew and started my friendship with Pete and Angel which I value greatly. </p><p> I attended as many parties as parenting allowed and met my now husband Glenn, an official photographer at Planet Angel, so with that and a combination of my daughter Alice reaching an age where I was happy to leave her, I was going every month! I wanted to get more involved with crewing and started off working on the Front of House crew, welcoming people at the door.</p> <p>I saw back in 2004 that there was a music coordinator role available and loved the idea of being able to go for it, but it just was not the right time and the lovely Rob Baggs took on the role. Then I found out Rob was planning on going travelling in 2007 and was looking for someone to take on the job! Oh boy, it was like a dream come true, the one job I had always wanted to do and a possibility of me doing it!</p> <p> I shadowed Rob for quite a few months, loved every minute of it and took on the role of Music Co-ordinator in August of 2007. I love the music at Planet Angel, always have, and feel very proud to now be involved in the music team and our fantastic DJ list!\r\n','1','12','0','46','2009-02-24 18:42:52','70','','2009-03-03 20:08:16','70','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2006-04-04 18:35:42','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','','pageclass_sfx=\nback_button=\nitem_title=1\nlink_titles=\nintrotext=1\nsection=0\nsection_link=0\ncategory=0\ncategory_link=0\nrating=\nauthor=\ncreatedate=\nmodifydate=\npdf=\nprint=\nemail=\nkeyref=\ndocbook_type=','3','0','1','','','0','67','jo-dunwell');

This of course didn\'t mean that my involvement with Planet Angel had to end. I still come to the parties all the time, even DJ occasionally, and help out as crew when life isn\'t too hectic. That\'s the one thing that made the transition easier for me – the fact that it\'s possible to be involved as little or as much as you want, in so many different ways. I still feel like part of the Planet Angel crew, and I love it. </P>','<P>I\'m now working as a conference co-ordinator at a Company called London Technology Network, a not for profit organisation that facilitates collaboration between businesses and universities, with the aim of driving innovation and partnerships between the two sectors. In a slightly obscure way it holds the same ideals as Planet Angel – encouraging people from different places and backgrounds to join together and create something special, whether it\'s a great party atmosphere or a new medical device is irrelevant in some ways! </P>\r\n<P>One of the most important things I learned when working with Planet Angel is that its all about the people, and they\'re fantastically like minded. I even bumped into whatleydude \"freehugs\" guy – a Planet Angel regular - at one of our events, and he happened to be one of our speakers! </P>\r\n<P>From the very beginning my work with Planet Angel was my trophy, proof that I could do a tough job well. When I was interviewed both for the recruitment agency and for London Technology Network, it was Planet Angel that stood out, and it was always the focus of conversation, because that\'s where I developed all the skills I needed to allow me to move on to pastures new. I was very lucky to have gained such hands on experience in a job with such transferable skills, and it has served me well in getting an interesting, challenging and well paid job.&nbsp; I\'m going to miss my role at Planet Angel a lot, but it has been left in very capable hands, and change is good and its necessary, it keeps things interesting.&nbsp; And at least no matter where I go or what I do, I will always be part of Planet Angel.</P>','1','1','0','1','2008-12-12 12:23:03','64','Lauren Gold','2008-12-12 12:23:28','0','0','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2008-12-12 12:18:39','0000-00-00 00:00:00','CrewContribs/lauren_120.jpg|right|Lauren\'s photo|0||bottom||','','pageclass_sfx=\nback_button=\nitem_title=1\nlink_titles=\nintrotext=1\nsection=0\nsection_link=0\ncategory=0\ncategory_link=0\nrating=\nauthor=\ncreatedate=\nmodifydate=\npdf=\nprint=\nemail=\nkeyref=\ndocbook_type=','1','0','10','','','0','404','lauren-takes-a-break');
