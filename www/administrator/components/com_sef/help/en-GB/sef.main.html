<h1>SEF Advance 2008 </h1>

<b>Congratulations, you are now in control of the most powerful SEF extension for Joomla! 1.5.</b><br />
<br />
SEF Advance 2008 is a component for Joomla! 1.5 which extends the built-in search engine friendly URL functionality and raises it on a higher level.<br />
Instead of ordinary SEF URLs like:<br />
http://www.site.com/menu-name/29-category/26-article which contain some numbers, you will now get URLs in form:<br />
http://www.site.com/section-name/category-name/article-name/<br />
<br />
Because your URLs will now consist of pure content titles with more logical structure, SEF Advance 2008 will increase your search engine positions.<br />
Your URLs will also be more user friendly and easier to remember. SEF Advance 2008 will also eliminate the duplicate content issues present   with the built-in URLs.<br />
<br />
You can setup the various URL preferences in the Configurations.<br />
If you need further clarification for various features be sure to read the help files.<br />
If your SEF Advance 2008 doesn't work, check the About page to make sure your server fulfills all the requirements.<br />
