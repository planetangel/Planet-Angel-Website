<h1>Configuration</h1>

This page is used to adjust SEF Advance operational settings.<br />
<br />
<b>Toolbar Actions</b><br />
<br />
<i>Save</i> - Saves the Configuration and returns to presentation list.<br />
<br />
<i>Cancel</i> - Cancels the modifications and returns to the control panel.<br />
<br />
<b>Field Details</b><br />
<br />
<b>Preferences Tab</b><br />
<i>SEF Advance enabled</i> - You can turn SEF Advance on / off here.<br />
When turned off, only the built-in SEF will be active (if SEF is activated in Global Configuration).<br />
<br />
<i>Fish support</i> - If you are using Joom!Fish / Mambelfish, the multilanguage component, this feature
will allow you to access multilingual content via URL. For example if you have content in
English and German you will have unique URL for each content version, e.g.:<br />
http://www.site.com/en/section/category/item/<br />
http://www.site.com/de/section/category/item/<br />
If you turn this feature on a disadvantage is that you can't have two-character section names or items.<br />
<br />
<i>Redirect built-in SEF URLs</i> - Redirects all requests for old-style, built-in, core SEF URLs
to corresponding SEF Advance URLs.
For example, a request for http://www.site.com/extensions/29-the-cms/26-extensions will be redirected to http://www.site.com/about-joomla/the-cms/extensions/.<br />
Doing this you avoid duplicate content to be detected by search engines.<br />
<br />
<i>Redirect non-SEF URLs</i> - Redirects all requests for non-SEF URLs to corresponding SEF Advance URLs.
For example, a request for http://www.site.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=26&amp;catid=29&amp;Itemid=40 will be redirected to http://www.site.com/about-joomla/the-cms/extensions/.<br />
Note that turning this setting on may break some 3rd party components that still depend on non-SEF URLs.<br />
<br />
<i>Redirect legacy SEF URLs</i> - Redirects all requests for legacy SEF URLs to corresponding SEF Advance URLs.
For example, a request for http://www.site.com/content/view/26/40/ will be redirected to http://www.site.com/about-joomla/the-cms/extensions/.<br />
This is useful if you upgraded from Joomla! 1.0 which used built-in SEF for a while and get indexed in search engines.<br />
<br />
<i>WWW redirect</i> - Redirects all requests for non-www to www URLs.
For example, a request for http://site.com will be redirected to http://www.site.com.<br />
This will help search engines decide canonical URL for your site and avoid double page rank and duplicate content penalties.<br />
<br />
<i>Log Not Found hits</i> - Logs URL requests that result in 404 Not Found error.<br />
<br />
<i>Debug</i> - Use only when troubleshooting the site. Selecting Yes will display some useful information about internal system state at the end of the page.<br />
Note that 404 Not Found page is disabled when debug is turned on.<br />
<br />
<i>Debug IP</i> - When entered, only the users coming from this IP address will be able to see the debug output. If empty, all visitors will see the debug information.<br />
<br />
<i>Space</i> - You can define the character that divides the words in URLs.<br />
Instead of default hyphen you can define an underscore (_) or something else.<br />
<br />
<i>Suffix</i> - SEF Advance allows you to define a suffix for the end of your URL.<br />
Instead of default trailing slash you can define a .html or something else.<br />
Suffix must be activated in Global Cofigurations.<br />
<br />
<i>Use title alias</i> - You can choose whether to have URLs by specified alias (news/latest/) or by titles (the-news/latest-news/) by selecting Yes or No option.<br />
If you choose Yes, SEF Advance will use section/content aliases instead of titles.<br />
It will also use title alias for articles so don't forget to enter aliases for each item.<br />
<br />
<i>Lower case</i> - Select Yes if you want all links automatically converted to lowercase.<br />
<br />
<i>Include section</i> - Selecting Yes includes section title in full article URL so it becomes, for example: section/category/article/<br />
Selecting No you get: category/article/<br />
<br />
<i>Include category</i> - Selecting Yes includes category title in full article URL so it becomes, for example: section/category/article/<br />
Selecting No you get: section/article/, or only article/ if section is excluded too.<br />
<br />
<i>Unique item</i> - To make your URLs more unique you may select Yes here.<br />
Every item will get creation date and id appended so it becomes unique and Google News friendly.<br />
<br />
<i>Fish support</i> - If you are using Joom!Fish, the multilanguage component, this feature
will allow you to access multilingual content via URL. For example if you have content in
English and German you will have unique URL for each content version, e.g.:<br />
http://www.site.com/en/section/category/item/<br />
http://www.site.com/de/section/category/item/<br />
If you turn this feature on note that you can't have two-character section names or items.<br />
<br />
<i>Skip prefix for def. lang.</i> - You can select whether you want to use the language prefix for default language.<br />
Check this option if you want to skip the prefix for default language.<br />
In this case the above example URLs will be:<br />
http://www.site.com/section/category/item/ - for default, English language<br />
http://www.site.com/de/section/category/item/ - for German language<br />
This will help preserve your original URLs if you installed Joom!Fish after the site was in use.<br />
<br />
<b>Strings Tab</b><br />
You can translate the strings used  for content and core components' URL strings here.<br />
<br />
If you have a 3rd party component  with SEF Advance extension (sef_ext.php) you can customize its default string by entering the replacement pair.
For example to replace word "userlist" in the URL with "u" you would enter:<br />
userlist=>u<br />
Separate replacement pairs by comma (,).<br />
<br />
<b>Replace Tab</b><br />
<i>URL replace</i> - This feature can be useful to international users having special characters in their languages.<br />
You can specify the characters that you want replaced rather than URL encoded in the URL string.
For example instead of having special character "æ" encoded with "%E6" you may choose to replace it
with "ae" which gives little friendlier URL:<br />
æ=>ae<br />
You can have as many replacement combinations as you want, just separate the pairs with a comma (,) in the text field.<br />
IMPORTANT: This setting should be used very carefully, remember that replacement works both ways. You can't replace a character
with a string that occurs in regular content titles. An example of wrong usage would be å=>a, as this would break all URLs
that contain "a". Instead use a string that doesn't occur in regular titles, like å=>aaa.<br />
<br />
<i>Encode exceptions</i> - To reduce the error rate, SEF Advance's URL is url encoded.<br />
This replaces all special characters with a percent (%) sign followed by two hex digits.<br />
Some users may think this doesn't look very nice in URL and that's why you can make exceptions from this rule.<br />
Just define the chars you don't want encoded in this text field:<br />
?|!|,|;|:<br />
Separate the chars with a pipe (|) in the text field.<br />
Note that not all characters can be excepted and you will have to test if the settings you enter cause problems for you.<br />
<br />
<i>Custom 404 page</i> - This setting allows you to setup a page that user will be directed to if no content has been found.<br />
This is similar to ordinary server 404 error redirect that user is sent to if non-existing site has been requested.
You can create an uncategorized article as 404 page and select it from the list or design a physical HTML file and type the relative link to it (example: 404.html).
You can also choose to use default 404 handler or redirect false requests to homepage. In this latter case a '301 Redirect' header will be returned to web browser and in all other cases a '404 Not Found' header will be returned.<br />
<br />
<b>Components Tab</b><br />
<i>Ignored components</i> - Some 3rd party components could be poorly coded and misbehave when SEF is activated.
In that case you can specify the components to be excluded from URL rewrite so you can still use them as with SEF turned off.<br />
Hold "Ctrl" to select multiple components.
<br />
<br />
<b>Cache Tab</b><br />
Caching can improve the performance for sites with much content by decreasing the database load.
If turned on, the system will use a cached copy of an URL instead of querying the database and calculating it on each request.<br />
<br />
You should use cache only when you have finished building your site. If you make any changes in URL configurations,
site structure, site menu, change names of existing articles, categories or sections, you must empty the cache!<br />
<br />
<i>Use cache</i> - Turns the caching system on or off.<br />
<br />
<i>Cache time</i> - Time of cached URL validity (in seconds), if the cache is turned on.<br />
Use a longer value for an established site and shorter for a site that still might be under construction.
The default is 86400 seconds (24 hours).<br />
<br />
<i>Empty Cache</i> - Flushes the cache. Empty the cache after each change of your site's structure.
<br />
<br />
<b>SEO Tab</b><br />
You can improve search engines optimization by automatically adding some important SEO elements to your website content.<br />
<br />
<i>Add H1 tags</i> - Inserts h1 tags on article titles styled with contentheading and h3 tags on titles styled with componentheading.
You can style the h1 tags in CSS.<br />
<br />
<i>Titles on Read more...</i> - Appends article title on Read more... hypertext links, thus helping identify the target of each link.<br />
<br />
<i>Add Alt-text</i> - Inserts description on article images with missing or empty alt-text.<br />
<br />
<i>Add NoFollow</i> - Inserts nofollow relation attribute to anchor tags for outgoing links.<br />
<br />
<i>Target Blank</i> - Inserts target=_blank to anchor tags for outgoing links to open them in new window, if target is not already specified.<br />
<br />
<i>New Window Icon</i> - Adds new window icon next to outgoing links.<br />
<br />
<i>Add Canonical</i> - Inserts Canonical tag to the page header to help Google decide the prefered URL in case of duplicate URLs leading to same content.
