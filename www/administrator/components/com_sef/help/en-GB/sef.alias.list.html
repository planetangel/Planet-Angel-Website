<h1>Alias &amp; Meta List</h1>

This page shows a list of the Aliases that have been saved in the database.<br />
If you are not happy with the look of a particular URL you can manually enter an alias for that link here.
This alias, if published, will then be used instead of automatically generated SEF URL.<br />
<br />
Along with the alias you can add custom Meta data for that particular page including Title, Description and Keywords.<br />
This will override automatically generated Meta data and give you greater SEO control over each individual page.<br />
<br />
You may enter text in the "Filter" box to refine the list based on whether the searched string is found in the Alias. Type in any string and press Enter.<br />
You may also limit the list by selecting the number of presented results from the dropdown box. You can move through the pages by clicking on links in the navigation bar on the bottom of the list.<br />
<br />
