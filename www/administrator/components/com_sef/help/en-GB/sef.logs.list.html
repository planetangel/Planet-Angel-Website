<h1>Log List</h1>

This page shows a list of the logged URLs that resulted in Not Found error and have been saved in the database.<br />
<br />
SEF Advance will log requested URLs which were not found, along with the time, IP address and referer of the click, so you can
fix the broken links or instruct the referers.<br />
Note that logging must be turned ON in configurations before SEF Advance can log clicked URLs.<br />
<br />
You may enter text in the "Filter" box to refine the list based on whether the searched string is found in the URL. Type in any string and press Enter.<br />
You may also limit the list by selecting the number of presented results from the dropdown box. You can move through the pages by clicking on links in the navigation bar on the bottom of the list.<br />
