JGA_CONFIGURATION_MANAGER=Configuration Manager
JGA_GENERAL_BACKEND_SETTINGS=General Settings
JGA_PATH_DIRECTORIES=Paths and Directories
JGA_PATH_DIRECTORIES_INTRO=Here you can specify the paths where your pictures ought to be saved. Although paths generally can be chosen without any restriction they should remain in the gallery folder. Otherwise you risk access problems. It is indicated whether a folder is writable for the gallery resp. whether the files are present (green) or not (red). In addition you can specify the desired date and time format on this page.
JGA_CSS_CONFIGURATION_INTRO=The JoomGallery is using a file in which all CSS-settings from the configuration manager are saved. You can find the file named joom_settings.css in the directory components/com_joomgallery/assets/css/. This file must be writable for the gallery. Regulary the file should have the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions" target="_blank">File permissions</a> 766. In the following there will be shown a status message about the capability to write this file:
JGA_PICTURES_PATH=Picture Path
JGA_PATH_PICTURES_STORED=Path to where pictures are saved. This is where downsized pictures are stored - provided that the automatic resizing is activated (see "Image Processing"). A copy of the original file will be saved if the automatic resizing is not activated. Images saved in this folder are used for display on the detail page.
JGA_ORIGINALS_PATH=Originals Picture Path:
JGA_PATH_ORIGINALS_STORED=Path to where originals are saved. This is where the original files are stored without resizing. Images saved in this folder are used for popup display provided that the popup option has been chosen.
JGA_THUMBNAILS_PATH=Thumbnails Path
JGA_PATH_THUMBNAILS_STORED=Path to where thumbnails are saved. This is where the automatically generated thumbnails are stored. The thumbnails are displayed in the gallery overview, the category overview and the top list page. In addition the thumbnails are used to generate the Minis
JGA_FTPUPLOAD_PATH=FTP Upload Path
JGA_PATH_FOR_FTPUPLOAD=Path to the FTP upload folder. This folder is used for FTP uploads. Pictures that you choose to add to the gallery via FTP go into this folder.
JGA_TEMP_PATH=Temp Path
JGA_PATH_FOR_TEMP=Path to the Temp folder. This folder is used for temporary actions, for example extracting zip-Files.
JGA_WATERMARK_PATH=Watermark Path
JGA_PATH_WATERMARK_STORED=Path to where the watermark is saved. In this path/folder the image for generating the watermark is saved. You need to specify a path here even if you do not activate the watermark function.
JGA_WATERMARK_FILE=Watermark File
JGA_WATERMARK_FILE_LONG=Name of the watermark file. You can choose a name for the watermark file without restriction. The file format needs to be a transparent .png file though. Obviously the file needs to be stored in the specified path.
JGA_TIME=Date/Time Format
JGA_TIME_LONG=What date/time format do you want to use? This setting has an impact on all appearances of date and time throughout the gallery. In few cases the server settings might overwrite this setting.
JGA_CHECKUPDATE=Check for updates?
JGA_CHECKUPDATE_LONG=Do you want the gallery to check automatically for available updates of itself and its extensions like JoomImages, for example? For this the gallery reads an <a href="http://www.en.joomgallery.net/components/com_newversion/rss/extensions.rss" target="_blank">RSS feed</a> provided on JoomGallery.net.
JGA_BACKEND_REPLACEMENTS=Replacements
JGA_BACKEND_REPLACEMENTS_INTRO=The name of pictures and categories are arbitrary. In order to save the picture and category names on the server it is necessary to remove special characters. With the following options you chose how to replace the special characters. The replacements have to be composed of the standard characters A-Z or numeric characters 0-9. Underscores _ are also possible. The replacements are only concerned to the filenames and foldernames to be saved in the filesystem on the server. They have no influence on the names shown at the frontend! An avoidance of special characters is accomplished automatically in each case. If in the following option no corresponding replacement is chosen existing special characters will be cancelled without substitution.
JGA_FILENAME_WITHJS=Prevent special characters
JGA_FILENAME_WITHJS_LONG=If you chose "Yes" in the following option can be defined which special characters in which mode will be replaced. Especially country specific characters as "ä" or "é" thus are transferred easily into "ae" or "e".
JGA_FILENAME_SEARCH=Special characters
JGA_FILENAME_SEARCH_LONG=Please fill in the special characters separated by &#921; which should be replaced.
JGA_FILENAME_REPLACE=New characters
JGA_FILENAME_REPLACE_LONG=Please fill in the new characters separated by &#921; which will be used to replace the special characters.
JGA_PICTURE_PROCESSING=Image Processing
JGA_PICTURE_CREATOR=Image Processor
JGA_NONE=None
JGA_GDLIB=GD Library
JGA_GD2LIB=GD2 Library
JGA_IMAGEMAGICK=ImageMagick
JGA_FAST_GD2_THUMBCREATION=Faster downsizing of pictures
JGA_FAST_GD2_THUMBCREATION_LONG=If image processor "GD2 Library" is chosen it is possible to define that for creation of thumbnails and optionally downsizing pictures an optimized function for the upload process shall be used. This function allows a much faster downsizing and therefore a shorter runtime of the upload script but is in need of four times bigger memory than the slower pendant. If there is only few memory available this option should not be chosen.
JGA_PATH_TO_IMAGEMAGICK=Path to ImageMagick
JGA_PICTURE_CREATOR_LONG=Choose the software for image processing. The software should already be installed on the server and is required for manipulating pictures such as resizing or adding a watermark to them. Most servers run a PHP version that already has the GD2 implemented. The GD version installed on your system is displayed in the line above this paragraph. If only the GD-Software is present you should always prefer GD2 because otherwise you will miss several manipulating functions. If ImageMagick is installed you should always prefer that software, because the results will be much more better.
JGA_RESIZING=Resizing
JGA_NO=No
JGA_YES=Yes
JGA_RESIZING_LONG=Do you want the pictures to be resized? If you enable the resizing all uploaded pictures will be resized to the maximum dimensions you have specified (one setting below this one). Those downsized pictures will be be used for display in the detail view. To prevent bursting the template it is good advice to enable this feature and to specify values that suit the template. If the feature remains disabled the pictures will be displayed in the size they have been uploaded. The resizing applies to the detail view only. The pictures used for the popup remain untouched and are displayed in their original upload size. If you want to affect the size of the popup you need to do that before you upload the pictures.
JGA_MAX_WIDTH=Max Width and Height
JGA_MAX_WIDTH_LONG=Maximum size of the pictures. This option works only if the resizing (one option above) is activated. The entered value (pixel) specifies the maximum dimensions of the picture and applies to both width and height. This means that the longest side will be taken to downsize the picture proportionally according to the entered value.
JGA_PICTURE_QUALITY=Quality
JGA_PICTURE_QUALITY_LONG=Quality of the picture after resizing. This option works only if the resizing (two options above) is activated. The entered value (percent) specifies the quality of the generated downsized pictures - in relation to the original picture. Mind that higher quality will require more server space.
JGA_THUMBNAILS_INTRO=Thumbnails are small copies of the picture. They are displayed as preview pictures on the category overview, the toplist pages and if desired on the gallery overview. All upload options of the front- and backend will automatically generate thumbnails. The settings you take here have an impact on all generated thumbnails.
JGA_DIRECTION_RESIZE=Thumbnail Conversion
JGA_SAMEHIGHT=by height
JGA_SAMEWIDTH=by width
JGA_DIRECTION_RESIZE_LONG=The purpose of the thumbnail conversion is to display all thumbs in either the same width or height without reference to the original picture format (portrait or landscape). Choosing "by height" for example will generate thumbs of the same height provided that the width is adequate. Entering equal values in the two options below in order to generate thumbnails with untouched aspect ratio will void the value entered here.
JGA_THUMBNAIL_WIDTH=Thumbnail Width
JGA_THUMBNAIL_WIDTH_LONG=Width of thumbnails. This is the maximum width if conversion is made by height.
JGA_THUMBNAIL_HEIGHT=Thumbnail Height
JGA_THUMBNAIL_HEIGHT_LONG=Height of thumbnails. This is the maximum height if conversion is made by width.
JGA_THUMBNAIL_QUALITY=Thumbnail Quality
JGA_THUMBNAIL_QUALITY_LONG=Quality of the generated thumbnails. The entered value (percent) specifies the quality of the generated thumbnails - in relation to the original picture. Mind that higher quality will require more server space.
JGA_BACKEND_UPLOAD=Backend-Upload
JGA_UPLOAD_ORDER=Ordering Numbers
JGA_NO_ORDER=none
JGA_DESCENDING=descending
JGA_ASCENDING=ascending
JGA_UPLOAD_ORDER_LONG=Do you want to assign ordering numbers to the pictures automatically? Which ordering sequence do you prefer? Ordering numbers are an important tool to control the arrangement of pictures in the frontend. Ordering numbers are stored in the data base and can be edited in the picture manager later on. Automatically assigning ordering numbers while uploading will make the arrangement of the picture in the frontend and the administrative management in the backend easier. Generally you should choose an ascending order. (This setting also applies to the frontend user upload.
JGA_ORIGINAL_FILENAME=Original Filename
JGA_ORIGINAL_FILENAME_LONG=Use original filename as picture title?
JGA_FILENAMENUMBER=Numbering
JGA_FILENAMENUMBER_LONG=Should the uploaded pictures be numbered consecutively?
JGA_DELETE_ORIGINAL=Delete original pictures after upload?
JGA_DELETE_ALL_ORIGINALS=Delete all original pictures
JGA_DELETE_ORIGINAL_CHECKBOX=Dialog box
JGA_DELETE_ORIGINAL_LONG=This option enables you to delete the original picture from the corresponding folder right after the upload. This is an interesting feature in case you have little server space and you do not depend on the popup function (popups are no longer displayed after the original file is deleted). If you choose the dialog box you will be asked every time you upload pictures in the backend whether or not to delete the original pictures.
JGA_WRONG_VALUE_COLOR=Background color for wrong entries
JGA_WRONG_VALUE_COLOR_LONG=The background of input boxes in the upload section containing a wrong or insufficient entry will be colored in the HEX value or color name you specify here.<br />Please leave the field empty if you do not want to change the color.

If you do not have CB / CBE installed set the option to "No". Pick the third option for the <a href="http://www.joomla-cbe.de/">"new" CBE</a> (link and folder com_cbe).
JGA_USERNAME_REALNAME=Real name instead of Username?
JGA_USERNAME_REALNAME_LONG=Should the real name instead of the username be displayed in the gallery (e.g. authors of pictures or comments)?
JGA_BRIDGE_SETTINGS=Bridges
JGA_BRIDGE_INSTALLED=Bridge installed?
JGA_BRIDGE_INSTALLED_LONG=Do you want to integrate a bridge? A bridge is an interface between the gallery and other joomla components or third party programmes. The opportunity to use individual bridges is fitted directly into the code of the gallery.  That way all environment variables of joomla and the gallery are made available. In case you do not use a bridge at the moment please enter "No" .
JGA_COOLIRIS_SUPPORT=Cooliris Support
JGA_COOLIRIS_SUPPORT_LONG=With the plug-in "Cooliris" (formerly PicLens) installed in the browser the pictures of a category can be displayed in a full screen gallery. Further information you will find <a href="http://www.cooliris.com/">here</a>. If the function is set to "yes" a small symbol is shown at the lower left of the thumbnail when moving the cursor over it. A click on it opens the Cooliris Gallery. At page by page design in the JoomGallery in the Cooliris Gallery the pictures will be loaded page after page dynamically by moving sidewards.
JGA_COOLIRIS_LINK=Link to start Cooliris

JGA_HEADER_AND_FOOTER=Header and Footer
JGA_HEADER_AND_FOOTER_INTRO=Basically the gallery is divided in three vertical areas: the head area at the top, the content area in the middle and the footer area at the bottom. The content area changes according to the different galleries and functions while the header and footer area remain almost static.
JGA_SHOW_GALLERYHEAD=Gallery Title

JGA_SHOW_DETAIL_IPTCDATA=Show IPTC data
JGA_SHOW_DETAIL_IPTCDATA_LONG=Shall the IPTC data of the chosen picture be shown if available? If "Yes" by the following options you can decide which information will be published. Otherwise they are ineffective.

The use of these specifications is only permitted if they remain unaltered from those defined in official IPTC publications. The specifications used here are from the document "<a href="http://iptc.cms.apa.at/std/photometadata/2008/specification/IPTC-PhotoMetadata-2008_2.pdf" target="_blank">Photo Metadata 2008</a>", which also contains all respective licensing details.

JGA_TOPLIST_THUMBALIGN=Alignment of the thumbnails
JGA_TOPLIST_THUMBALIGN_LONG=Alignment of the thumbnails within the columns. At single-column view the thumbnails will be aligned along a fictive tripline left sided as defined in this option.

JGA_TOPLIST_TEXTALIGN=Alignment of the details
